                      straight.</b>
                      <span class="break"></span>
                      The bureau, which operates independently from
                      the
                      well-known
                      customs
                      administration
                      (GACC), continually said the product was above
                      its allowed limits for nitrate and nitrite—even
                      though the importer and exporter tests both
                      showed they were within limits.
                      <span class="break"></span>
                      They finally had to hire a law firm to help them
                      coordinate with a local inspection bureau so
                      they could do identical product tests on both
                      sides and compare results. However, the
                      Chinese bureau’s standards allowed for only
                      three testing methods, two of which weren’t
                      even used in the US. They both agreed to do the
                      tests using the remaining third method and
                      identical materials, yielding results that finally
                      allowed the company to ship to China. Without
                      the law firm’s friendly relationship with the local
                      inspection bureau, their products would still be
                      languishing across the sea.

                    Getting a product approved for trade can
                    be a laborious process, even when your
                    country’s highest leaders approve and
                    get involved.
                    <span class="break"></span>
                    After Russian sanctions against EU products in
                    2014, Poland’s apple trade decreased almost
                    20% in a single year from 1.1 to 0.88 million
                    tons. Russia had been 1/3 of its apple exports. To
                    boost its apple trade, Poland applied for a trade
                    agreement to import apples to China in August
                    2014.
                    <span class="break"></span>
                    Fresh vegetables and fruits are especially
                    difficult to be approved for import to China;
                    even though they usually have fewer risks of
                    contamination, the Chinese government treated
                    with politically weighty fruit import with the
                    procedural caution usually reserved for animal
                    products. All grower hygiene methods and
                    qualities had to be adjusted and inspected, and
                    each apple had to be traced back to its origins.
                    <span class="break"></span>
                    The trade agreement was finalized almost two
                    years later in June 2016—this after a series of
                    inspections, meetings between the two
                    country’s heads of states, and after the Polish
                    prime minister personally requested that the
                    agreement be expedited. According to the
                    Polish embassy in Beijing though, this was
                    actually the FASTEST negotiation of this kind
                    from EU states to the China market.

                    Regardless of the product, be prepared to wait at
                    least a year for your product to be approved. If
                    you’re not prepared for this, it could cause
                    immense delays in your entry strategy. And
                    remember: just meeting the regulations isn’t
                    enough in China; it can also change them
                    anytime. In this case, even though fruits and
                    vegetables have less stringent quality inspection
                    standards, the Chinese government treated
                    them with the same standards as animal
                    products.
                    <span class="break"></span>
                    Regulations now are much stricter than a few
                    decades ago, when China was just opening up
                    and wanting to attract foreign companies. Now
                    foreign companies are clamoring to enter, and
                    China can pick and choose.

                  China differs from the EU, the US and
                  most other countries in the world for
                  having a “first-to-file” trademark system.
                  <span class="break"></span>
                  Companies like Apple have had to pay millions
                  of dollars in court and settlement fees bcause
                  Chinese companies can lay claim to patents
                  even if they weren’t the first to develop a certain
                  technology—as long as they were first to USE
                  them in a Chinese market product.
                  <span class="break"></span>
                  In July 2012, Apple paid $60 million to a small
                  vendor for ownership of the “iPad” trademark,
                  which the local Chinese company had previously
                  registered. This delayed the introduction of the
                  iPad 2 in China. More recently, another
                  little-known startup won a case against Apple’s
                  iPhone 6 and 6 Plus based on a smartphone
                  design patent.
                  <span class="break"></span>
                  Foreign companies often get entangled in
                  intellectual property battles in China, where the
                  courts proetect local intellectual property
                  rights and the sheer number of companies
                  means names aren’t guaranteed. China filed
                  12.5% more patent applications and 18.2% more
                  trademark applications in 2015 compared to the
                  year before, and this number is only growing.
                  The same goes for domain names; when
                  GroupOn tried to register as groupon.cn or
                  groupon.com.cn, the names had already been
                  registered by a copycat Chinese competitor,
                  complete with the GroupOn company name,
                  logo, and site design. It could do nothing about
                  the copying, and also had to use a much less
                  recognizable domain.

                  Protect your trademark from China’s first-to-file
                  system as soon as you can, even before your
                  company sets foot in China. In our experience, it
                  usually takes around 18 months for a foreign

                Our client, a U.S. NGO, runs summer programs
                in the U.S. for students from China. An agent in
                China promoted their programs abroad. But
                when the NGO wanted to open an office in
                China, they discovered the agent had already
                registered their HOBY trademark for
                themselves. LITAO served as their go-between.
              </p>
              <span class="subtitle color-red ">The LITAO approach to a Stolen Trademark</span>
              <p class="content">The first reaction in such a situation may be an
                immediate sense of betrayal: the NGO couldn’t
                even use their own logo as promotion since the
                trademark had already been taken.
                <span class="break"></span>
                It may seem justified to confront the agent in
                question with accusations, but LITAO
                encouraged the organization to stay calm. We
                knew intellectual property rights worked
                differently in China, and our lawyers confirmed
                the same. We advised a communication strategy
                to test the waters, and as it turns out, the agent
                had registered the trademark for the benefit of
                the NGO as well as themselves—so other
                Chinese organizations would not fake their
                programs, another common occurence in China.

                <p class="content">
Trademark battles, if gone wrong, can cost
enormous amounts of money, with the Chinese
court system favoring the Chinese company that
had registered first. But as there was good will on
both sides, the agent agreed to transfer the IP
rights to the NGO free of charge. The two went
on to further cooperation—this would not have
happened had the communication strategy been
one of blame and accusation.

                For a long time, the diapers industry did not
                take off in China—until 2007, when Proctor &
                Gamble launched an ad campaign linking
                diaper-wearing to better sleep—and research
                showing that this “golden sleep” meant better
                brain development. For a country where parents
                will do anything to ensure their kids’ success in
                school, sales went up 55%—and as another
                marketing boon, P&G received 200,000
                photos of sleeping infants wearing their brand.

                Where else in the world could you sell diapers via

                For memorable branding, talk about yourself in a
                way local people can understand. The Chinese
                don’t believe storks bring babies, so don’t
                advertise your products as such. Meanwhile, the
                Chinese ARE obsessed with their children’s
                education and test scores, so use that as a
                leverage point. Make the connection between
                your product and the culture you’re trying to sell
                to by finding out what they truly care about, and
                how you can help.

                    This is the by-now famous story of Starbucks: a
                    coffee
                    company
                    trying

                    enter

                    thousand-year+
                    tea
                    culture.
                    Starbucks
                    researchers realized they could sell not the
                    coffee as a product itself, but an experience
                    around it.
<span class="break"></span>
                    They invested in prime, central business
                    locations; leather armchairs, plush sofas, and
                    other posh decor in a dimly lit environment; and
                    outdoor seating with parasols for a European
                    ambience. Businessmen could hold meetings in
                    the private but bustling atmosphere; the
                    status-conscious could sit and sip with their
                    girlfriends in front of the large glass windows,
                    taking selfies and hoping to be seen.
<span class="break"></span>
                    Coffee as a status symbol of the West was
                    perfect for a country with a growing
                    upper-middle class that loves conspicuous
                    consumption. Starbucks gave them more than a
                    drink; it gave them a certain enviable experience
                    and lifestyle. And China has now become its
                    largest market outside of the U.S.

                    that way, the way Starbucks, Pizza Hut, and
                    Haagen-Dasz did to great success in China. They
                    sold more than food and drink; they sold
                    luxurious surroundings, status, and associations

                    versions can truly make or break you.
<span class="break"></span>
                    Creating a great brand name is not only a
                    powerful marketing tool; if you don’t create it,
                    you might not like what the Chinese consumers
                    call it in its place. Two famous trademarks that
                    did not make Chinese versions of their brand
                    before entering the market met this fate.
                    Chinese found it difficult to pronounce the
                    phonetics of their foreign names in Chinese, so
                    they called them by their logos: Quaker
                    Oatmeal thus became “Lao Ren Pai,” which
                    translates to “Old Man Brand,” and Ralph
                    Lauren became “Three-Legged Horse.” Not
                    exactly sexy branding.
<span class="break"></span>
                    Meanwhile, Coca-cola is an early example of
                    good branding at work; it was first sold in China
                    in 1927, but local shopkeepers couldn’t figure
                    out what to call it in China. They tried to find
                    Chinese characters that sounded close to the
                    name, coming up with a pool of 200 or so
                    characters. But the names the shopkeepers
                    came up with had strange definitions: though
                    they were phonetically similar, the meanings
                    varied from “female horse fastened with wax” to
                    “bite the wax tadpole.”
<span class="break"></span>
                    It was only a year later that Coca-Cola
                    employees finally registered its current name: a
                    combination of characters that means “to
                    permit mouth to be able to rejoice”—a huge step
                    up from horses and tadpoles the copying, and
                    also had to use a much less recognizable domain.

                    “Democracy” is the most celebrated play of
                    Mindaugas
                    Nastaravicius—a
                    Lithuanian
                    playwright who won a “Golden Cross of the
                    Stage,” the highest award for theater in
                    Lithuania.
<span class="break"></span>
                    LITAO was approached to translate this play and
                    adapt it for China for the 2016 Bookworm
                    International Literary Festival.

                  <p class="content">
                    True literary translation means cultural
                    integration. Beyond language, we had to make
                    sure ALL the elements of the play, from names
                    and characters to jokes and cultural references,
                    worked in China.
<span class="break"></span>
                    Even the title of the play—Democracy—could
                    attract unwanted political attention in a country
                    like China. We changed it to an innocuous title
                    in Chinese, 停电大楼, similar to “The Power is
                    Out”—something intriguing without alerting the
                    eyes of Chinese censors.
<span class="break"></span>
                    The playwright had intended to translate simply
                    the original concept and ideas—knowing that
                    while his topics were universal, his references
                    were not—and we worked with him closely to get
                    his vision right but also relevant for China.
<span class="break"></span>
                    His play featured Lithuanians in various social
                    strata with personalities and characteristics
                    familiar to Lithuanians; we adjusted that to
                    prototypical characters from mainland China. A
                    Russian Lithuanian therefore became a
                    character from Northeast China, both known
                    for their thick accents and alcoholic tolerance.
                    All Catholic references were changed to
                    Buddhist ones to better reflect local Chinese
                    roots.
<span class="break"></span>
                    We collaborated on all of this to the author’s
                    satisfaction within only one(!) month./p>

                      The Chinese reading of the play was
                      well-received by audience members at the 2016
                      Bookworm Festival in Chengdu, China; the
                      festival organizers were also extremely
                      impressed at our culturally-astute adaptation.
                      Subsequently, the playwright was approached by
                      mainland China theaters offering to stage the
                      play, as well as opportunities to publish it in

                      After extensive market research and mystery
                      visits to all key foreign grocery retailers in
                      Shanghai to determine best-performing SKUs,
                      our most prominent strategy was to go the route
                      of premiumization. After all, the company could
                      not hope to compete with Chinese brands on
                      pricing. And data on China predicted increased
                      consumer awareness of food quality as well as a
                      decline in meat consumption—an opportunity
                      for seafood. Yet we found that this was only if
                      seafood was presented as high-quality protein
                      with a story behind it; premium brands have
                      company narratives while mass-market ones
                      don’t.
<span class="break"></span>
                      To create our company story, we learned the
                      origins of the fish in Lithuania and researched
                      specifications from top certifying bodies such as
                      the Marine Stewardship Council to find what
                      most concerned consumers about quality. We
                      also researched factors from packaging
                      convenience to location for our target market,
                      modern urban premium consumers.

                      Interpretation is not to be taken lightly.
                      In fact, Fortune Magazine has named
                      interpreter Zhang Lu as one of the
                      “world’s most powerful women.”

                      She serves as the voice of China’s top leaders,
                      including Premier Li Keqiang. In diplomatic
                      situations, the interpreter’s voice stands as the
                      voice of authority, and any deviation from both
                      meaning and tone is an indictment on the nation
                      itself.
                      <span class="break"></span>
                      The U.S. Department of State had to learn this
                      the hard way. When then-U.S. Secretary of
                      State Hillary Clinton met Russian Foreign
                      Minister Sergei Lavrov in 2009, she presented
                      him a joke gift of a mock “reset” button—in
                      symbolic honor of a relationship reset between
                      the U.S. and Russia from tensions in the past.
                      But the word the State Department chose for
                      “reset” was the Russian “peregruzka,” which
                      wrongly meant “overload”—the opposite of the
                      meaning they were trying to convey (overload of
                      tensions is never good), as Lavrov was quick to
                      point out.
                      <span class="break"></span>
                      The correct word for “reset” in Russian required
                      an extra syllable: “perezagruzka.” If only the
                      resources of the State Department had thought
                      to first check the translation with a Russian
                      expert!

                      In the early 1990’s, prospects were good
                      for the growth of tourism and
                      investment in Yunnan, a province with
                      unique ethnicities and bountiful nature
                      in Southwest China. The Roaring Dragon
                      at that time was a well-known
                      40-year-old four-star hotel, one of the
                      first in the region, owned by the
                      provincial government and managed by
                      local Chinese.
<span class="break"></span>
                      But as a state-owned enterprise, their close to
                      700 staff lacked motivation since steady salaries
                      would be paid for by the government in any case,
                      and even though the hotel was still profitable,
                      the government thought it wasn’t meeting its
                      potential.
<span class="break"></span>
                      And so the government contracted foreign
                      management companies to take over:
                      One takeover in 1993 lost them nine million
                      RMB in a year.
                      The second one in 1999, by an international
                      hotel brand named Nothill, lost more than ten
                      million RMB in less than four months, with hotel
                      capacity nearing empty towards the end.
<span class="break"></span>
                      In between these two periods, when Chinese
                      management retook the system, the hotel did
                      well again. It was clear that the foreign
                      management did have better standards of
                      services and more high-class hotel experience.
                      But their international reputation did nothing to
                      attract visitors; in fact, it sometimes seemed
                      arrogant.
<span class="break"></span>
                      Both times, foreign-educated managers
                      neglected the Chinese element of guanxi, or
                      connections. These connections always came
                      with a price: they were relationships of “you help
                      me, I help you.” Giving discounts to friends in
                      tour agencies meant they would bring their
                      groups to you. Hosting banquets in honor of
                      government officials meant you could pass
                      through bureaucratic processes much more
                      smoothly. Hiring your friends or relatives meant
                      they owed you something. The regular up-dating
                      of these guanxi—meals, tea, gifts, even leisurely
                      chats over nothing—were essential for
                      relationship maintenance of mutual benefit..

                      Guanxi is effective, but it is not always efficient.
                      Foreign managers at the Roaring Dragon saw it
                      simply as favoritism or nepotism; they banned
                      discounts, hiring based on connections, and
                      other incentives based on guanxi. Once, a
                      foreign F&B manager outright refused a tour
                      group a banquet because he deemed it too
                      cheap. The tour agency, which another Chinese
                      manager had carefully cultivated guanxi with and
                      which often booked large groups into the hotel,
                      never booked tour groups in the hotel again. The
                      guanxi was ruined, and the agent left to a
                      competitor. Government officials were no longer
                      given star treatment and discounts, so they left,
                      too.
<span class="break"></span>
                      Employees also complained that “the foreign
                      management did not know the Chinese way”:
                      they were no longer allowed to take long breaks,
                      to invite their friends to the hotel for no reason,
                      even to eat with each other as per new schedules.
                      Long-time employees who were made redundant
                      complained of not being treated with respect,
                      since they were being laid off and paid on a single
                      day without prior notice. Employee morale had
                      depressed so much that even if they were not
                      made redundant under new policies, many
                      high-level employees left of their own accord,
                      oftentimes with years of guanxi.
<span class="break"></span>
                      Guanxi, because it is so personal, is something
                      that is not transferable. In their quest to make
                      everything more efficient, foreign managers had
                      actually lost the very business and people they
                      sought to attract.

                      The Lithuanian Minister of Culture visited
                      Shanghai
                      to
                      discuss
                      cooperation
                      with
                      representatives of five major Chinese cultural
                      stakeholders, including Shanghai vice-mayor

                      <span class="break"></span>
                      Lina served as a diplomatic interpreter between
                      the two cultural delegations in a series of
                      meetings, both formal and informal, in 2016.

                    <p class="content">
                      The Lithuanian cultural delegation included not
                      just the Minister of Culture, but also the heads
                      of Lithuanian national ballet, opera, theater, and
                      art galleries. Shanghai as a major metropolis has
                      its choice of international arts productions, so
                      any potential collaborations would be based on a
                      sense of rapport and camaraderie.
                      <span class="break"></span>
                      In fact, this was why Lina was there: to show that
                      a native Lithuanian could speak high-level
                      Chinese as a nod of cultural respect. Since
                      direct Lithuanian-Chinese professional interpreters
                      are rare, most delegations communicate
                      through the common medium of English. The
                      Chinese side had English translators in place,
                      but as this was a meeting of cultural
                      stakeholders, it seemed essential to allow the
                      Lithuanians as well, especially the cultural
                      minister, to speak directly from their culture:
                      their language.
                      <span class="break"></span>
                      Prior to the meetings, we had already
                      researched the delegation’s communication
                      points along with the latest cultural trends in
                      Shanghai and Lithuania, learned the finer points
                      of diplomatic versus informal language, and
                      dove into the details of each meeting
                      participant’s background to be ready to address
                      each one with the proper respect and title.

                      By allowing the Lithuanian minister and Chinese
                      vice-mayor to both speak their native tongues,
                      by having a Lithuanian to translate into fluent
                      high-level Chinese and vice versa—LITAO
                      enabled both sides to pay the ultimate cultural
                      respect. In 2016, China has become the largest
                      market of Lithuanian cultural products,
                      especially theater.

                      Cultural collaborations between countries take
                      years in the making, but they all start with the
                      mutual respect and friendship laid in place here.
                      Even the formal meetings had a friendly tone, as
                      Lina explained beyond the meanings of official
                      statements to relate to each country’s culture.
                      The Lithuanian Minister of Culture himself
                      commented, “it is a luxury to have an interpreter
                      who understands context.”

                    Flintas, a Lithuanian children’s books publisher,
                    was entering the China International Children’s
                    Book Fair in Shanghai for the first time. Though
                    a thriving publisher in its home country, it didn’t
                    know any of the requirements for China’s strict
                    censorship laws and differentiations between
                    publishers. LITAO was hired prior to and during
                    the exhibition to prepare Flintas’ offerings and
                    seek potential matches.

                    We first sorted through the publisher’s hundreds
                    of titles to determine what would work best,
                    settling on a total of twelve books marketed to
                    children up to five years old. The age limit itself
                    was a strategic move: the more illustrations and
                    fewer words, the less there would be to censor.
                    We also focused on titles with immediate
                    positive utility, such as books that improved
                    children’s hand mobility.
                    <span class="break"></span>
                    At the exhibition itself, we had to keep alert for
                    proper matches—offiicial publishing house
                    acquirers who would buy the books’ copyrights
                    for China and NOT undercover creative
                    directors who would copy the Lithuanian books’
                    innovative educational methods. As such, we
                    had to be very selective with the information we
                    gave away, filtering through layers of
                    conversation to discover the true roles of the
                    various inquirers.

                    Taking advantage of foreign companies who
                    don’t
                    know
                    the
                    real
                    rules,
                    Chinese
                    manufacturers and deliverers often try to dupe
                    foreigners by stating “such and such is Chinese
                    law”: things like requiring the foreign company
                    to transfer IP ownership or enter into exclusive
                    distribution arrangeemtns with Chinese
                    companies.

                    There are no such laws for IP transfer or
                    exclusivity requirements! In fact, it is extremely
                    important not to enter into exclusivity
                    arrangements with a distributor/marketer/seller
                    because even if they are very good in one region
                    of China, they may not be in another.

                    In addition, if they have an exclusivity
                    agreement with you, it is possible they have
                    another agreement with a competitor company.
                    They may simply choose not to sell your product
                    so the other one doesn’t suffer from the
                    competition, and because you signed X years of
                    exclusivity, there is nothing you can do.

                    Exclusive distribution is part of what led
                    Hershey’s down the hole in China: its sales in
                    2015 were USD 90 million less than the
                    projected USD 200 million, mostly because it
                    had acquired a local candy maker company
                    called Shanghai Golden Monkey to expand its
                    local distributor network. But the distributor
                    and customer network was not as broad or as
                    stable as they had believed—and since they had
                    spent USD 584 million acquiring the company,
                    they were stuck with them.
