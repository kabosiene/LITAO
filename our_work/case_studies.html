                      straight.</b>
                      <span class="break"></span>
                      The bureau, which operates independently from
                      the
                      well-known
                      customs
                      administration
                      (GACC), continually said the product was above
                      its allowed limits for nitrate and nitrite—even
                      though the importer and exporter tests both
                      showed they were within limits.
                      <span class="break"></span>
                      They finally had to hire a law firm to help them
                      coordinate with a local inspection bureau so
                      they could do identical product tests on both
                      sides and compare results. However, the
                      Chinese bureau’s standards allowed for only
                      three testing methods, two of which weren’t
                      even used in the US. They both agreed to do the
                      tests using the remaining third method and
                      identical materials, yielding results that finally
                      allowed the company to ship to China. Without
                      the law firm’s friendly relationship with the local
                      inspection bureau, their products would still be
                      languishing across the sea.

                    Getting a product approved for trade can
                    be a laborious process, even when your
                    country’s highest leaders approve and
                    get involved.
                    <span class="break"></span>
                    After Russian sanctions against EU products in
                    2014, Poland’s apple trade decreased almost
                    20% in a single year from 1.1 to 0.88 million
                    tons. Russia had been 1/3 of its apple exports. To
                    boost its apple trade, Poland applied for a trade
                    agreement to import apples to China in August
                    2014.
                    <span class="break"></span>
                    Fresh vegetables and fruits are especially
                    difficult to be approved for import to China;
                    even though they usually have fewer risks of
                    contamination, the Chinese government treated
                    with politically weighty fruit import with the
                    procedural caution usually reserved for animal
                    products. All grower hygiene methods and
                    qualities had to be adjusted and inspected, and
                    each apple had to be traced back to its origins.
                    <span class="break"></span>
                    The trade agreement was finalized almost two
                    years later in June 2016—this after a series of
                    inspections, meetings between the two
                    country’s heads of states, and after the Polish
                    prime minister personally requested that the
                    agreement be expedited. According to the
                    Polish embassy in Beijing though, this was
                    actually the FASTEST negotiation of this kind
                    from EU states to the China market.

                    Regardless of the product, be prepared to wait at
                    least a year for your product to be approved. If
                    you’re not prepared for this, it could cause
                    immense delays in your entry strategy. And
                    remember: just meeting the regulations isn’t
                    enough in China; it can also change them
                    anytime. In this case, even though fruits and
                    vegetables have less stringent quality inspection
                    standards, the Chinese government treated
                    them with the same standards as animal
                    products.
                    <span class="break"></span>
                    Regulations now are much stricter than a few
                    decades ago, when China was just opening up
                    and wanting to attract foreign companies. Now
                    foreign companies are clamoring to enter, and
                    China can pick and choose.

                  China differs from the EU, the US and
                  most other countries in the world for
                  having a “first-to-file” trademark system.
                  <span class="break"></span>
                  Companies like Apple have had to pay millions
                  of dollars in court and settlement fees bcause
                  Chinese companies can lay claim to patents
                  even if they weren’t the first to develop a certain
                  technology—as long as they were first to USE
                  them in a Chinese market product.
                  <span class="break"></span>
                  In July 2012, Apple paid $60 million to a small
                  vendor for ownership of the “iPad” trademark,
                  which the local Chinese company had previously
                  registered. This delayed the introduction of the
                  iPad 2 in China. More recently, another
                  little-known startup won a case against Apple’s
                  iPhone 6 and 6 Plus based on a smartphone
                  design patent.
                  <span class="break"></span>
                  Foreign companies often get entangled in
                  intellectual property battles in China, where the
                  courts proetect local intellectual property
                  rights and the sheer number of companies
                  means names aren’t guaranteed. China filed
                  12.5% more patent applications and 18.2% more
                  trademark applications in 2015 compared to the
                  year before, and this number is only growing.
                  The same goes for domain names; when
                  GroupOn tried to register as groupon.cn or
                  groupon.com.cn, the names had already been
                  registered by a copycat Chinese competitor,
                  complete with the GroupOn company name,
                  logo, and site design. It could do nothing about
                  the copying, and also had to use a much less
                  recognizable domain.

                  Protect your trademark from China’s first-to-file
                  system as soon as you can, even before your
                  company sets foot in China. In our experience, it
                  usually takes around 18 months for a foreign

                Our client, a U.S. NGO, runs summer programs
                in the U.S. for students from China. An agent in
                China promoted their programs abroad. But
                when the NGO wanted to open an office in
                China, they discovered the agent had already
                registered their HOBY trademark for
                themselves. LITAO served as their go-between.
              </p>
              <span class="subtitle color-red ">The LITAO approach to a Stolen Trademark</span>
              <p class="content">The first reaction in such a situation may be an
                immediate sense of betrayal: the NGO couldn’t
                even use their own logo as promotion since the
                trademark had already been taken.
                <span class="break"></span>
                It may seem justified to confront the agent in
                question with accusations, but LITAO
                encouraged the organization to stay calm. We
                knew intellectual property rights worked
                differently in China, and our lawyers confirmed
                the same. We advised a communication strategy
                to test the waters, and as it turns out, the agent
                had registered the trademark for the benefit of
                the NGO as well as themselves—so other
                Chinese organizations would not fake their
                programs, another common occurence in China.

                Trademark battles, if gone wrong, can cost
                enormous amounts of money, with the Chinese
                court system favoring the Chinese company that
                had registered first. But as there was good will on
                both sides, the agent agreed to transfer the IP
                rights to the NGO free of charge. The two went
                on to further cooperation—this would not have
                happened had the communication strategy been
                one of blame and accusation.

                  For a long time, the diapers industry did not
                  take off in China—until 2007, when Proctor &
                  Gamble launched an ad campaign linking
                  diaper-wearing to better sleep—and research
                  showing that this “golden sleep” meant better
                  brain development. For a country where parents
                  will do anything to ensure their kids’ success in
                  school, sales went up 55%—and as another
                  marketing boon, P&G received 200,000
                  photos of sleeping infants wearing their brand.

                  Where else in the world could you sell diapers via

                  For memorable branding, talk about yourself in a
                  way local people can understand. The Chinese
                  don’t believe storks bring babies, so don’t
                  advertise your products as such. Meanwhile, the
                  Chinese ARE obsessed with their children’s
                  education and test scores, so use that as a
                  leverage point. Make the connection between
                  your product and the culture you’re trying to sell
                  to by finding out what they truly care about, and
                  how you can help.

                Sometimes the local culture doesn’t use

                gives you something else to offer.
                <span class="break"></span>
                This is the by-now famous story of Starbucks: a
                coffee
                company
                trying
                to
                enter
                a
                thousand-year+
                tea
                culture.
                Starbucks
                researchers realized they could sell not the
                coffee as a product itself, but an experience
                around it.
                <span class="break"></span>
                They invested in prime, central business
                locations; leather armchairs, plush sofas, and
                other posh decor in a dimly lit environment; and
                outdoor seating with parasols for a European
                ambience. Businessmen could hold meetings in
                the private but bustling atmosphere; the
                status-conscious could sit and sip with their
                girlfriends in front of the large glass windows,
                taking selfies and hoping to be seen.
                <span class="break"></span>
                Coffee as a status symbol of the West was
                perfect for a country with a growing
                upper-middle class that loves conspicuous
                consumption. Starbucks gave them more than a
                drink; it gave them a certain enviable experience
                and lifestyle. And China has now become its
                largest market outside of the U.S.

                People don’t always want a product or service for
                itself—they want the good feelings and

                perspectives you can offer and brand yourself
                that way, the way Starbucks, Pizza Hut, and
                Haagen-Dasz did to great success in China. They
                sold more than food and drink; they sold
                luxurious surroundings, status, and associations
                with the West. You can even sell soulfulness, as

                powerful marketing tool; if you don’t create it,
                you might not like what the Chinese consumers
                call it in its place. Two famous trademarks that
                did not make Chinese versions of their brand
                before entering the market met this fate.
                Chinese found it difficult to pronounce the
                phonetics of their foreign names in Chinese, so
                they called them by their logos: Quaker
                Oatmeal thus became “Lao Ren Pai,” which
                translates to “Old Man Brand,” and Ralph
                Lauren became “Three-Legged Horse.” Not
                exactly sexy branding.
                <span class="break"></span>
                Meanwhile, Coca-cola is an early example of
                good branding at work; it was first sold in China
                in 1927, but local shopkeepers couldn’t figure
                out what to call it in China. They tried to find
                Chinese characters that sounded close to the
                name, coming up with a pool of 200 or so
                characters. But the names the shopkeepers
                came up with had strange definitions: though
                they were phonetically similar, the meanings
                varied from “female horse fastened with wax” to
                “bite the wax tadpole.”
                <span class="break"></span>
                It was only a year later that Coca-Cola
                employees finally registered its current name: a
                combination of characters that means “to
                permit mouth to be able to rejoice”—a huge step
                up from horses and tadpoles the copying, and
                also had to use a much less recognizable domain.

                Don’t wait for others to define you; since they
                don’t care about your reputation, their haphazard

                Choose a localized brand name with its

                “Democracy” is the most celebrated play of
                Mindaugas
                Nastaravicius—a
                Lithuanian
                playwright who won a “Golden Cross of the
                Stage,” the highest award for theater in
                Lithuania.
                <span class="break"></span>
                LITAO was approached to translate this play and
                adapt it for China for the 2016 Bookworm
                International Literary Festival.

                True literary translation means cultural
                integration. Beyond language, we had to make
                sure ALL the elements of the play, from names
                and characters to jokes and cultural references,
                worked in China.
                <span class="break"></span>
                Even the title of the play—Democracy—could
                attract unwanted political attention in a country
                like China. We changed it to an innocuous title
                in Chinese, 停电大楼, similar to “The Power is
                Out”—something intriguing without alerting the
                eyes of Chinese censors.
                <span class="break"></span>
                The playwright had intended to translate simply
                the original concept and ideas—knowing that
                while his topics were universal, his references
                were not—and we worked with him closely to get
                his vision right but also relevant for China.
                <span class="break"></span>
                His play featured Lithuanians in various social
                strata with personalities and characteristics
                familiar to Lithuanians; we adjusted that to
                prototypical characters from mainland China. A
                Russian Lithuanian therefore became a
                character from Northeast China, both known
                for their thick accents and alcoholic tolerance.
                All Catholic references were changed to
                Buddhist ones to better reflect local Chinese
                roots.
                <span class="break"></span>
                We collaborated on all of this to the author’s
                satisfaction within only one(!) month.

                  The Chinese reading of the play was
                  well-received by audience members at the 2016

                  festival organizers were also extremely
                  impressed at our culturally-astute adaptation.
                  Subsequently, the playwright was approached by
                  mainland China theaters offering to stage the

                  China itself is the world’s largest (and cheap!)
                  producer of surimi and other fish products, so

                  visits to all key foreign grocery retailers in
                  Shanghai to determine best-performing SKUs,
                  our most prominent strategy was to go the route
                  of premiumization. After all, the company could
                  not hope to compete with Chinese brands on
                  pricing. And data on China predicted increased
                  consumer awareness of food quality as well as a
                  decline in meat consumption—an opportunity
                  for seafood. Yet we found that this was only if
                  seafood was presented as high-quality protein
                  with a story behind it; premium brands have
                  company narratives while mass-market ones

                  To create our company story, we learned the

                  specifications from top certifying bodies such as
                  the Marine Stewardship Council to find what
                  most concerned consumers about quality. We
                  also researched factors from packaging
                  convenience to location for our target market,
                  modern urban premium consumers.

                  Interpretation is not to be taken lightly.
                  In fact, Fortune Magazine has named
                  interpreter Zhang Lu as one of the
                  “world’s most powerful women.”
                  <span class="break"></span>
                  She serves as the voice of China’s top leaders,
                  including Premier Li Keqiang. In diplomatic
                  situations, the interpreter’s voice stands as the
                  voice of authority, and any deviation from both
                  meaning and tone is an indictment on the nation
                  itself.
                  <span class="break"></span>
                  The U.S. Department of State had to learn this
                  the hard way. When then-U.S. Secretary of
                  State Hillary Clinton met Russian Foreign
                  Minister Sergei Lavrov in 2009, she presented
                  him a joke gift of a mock “reset” button—in
                  symbolic honor of a relationship reset between
                  the U.S. and Russia from tensions in the past.
                  But the word the State Department chose for
                  “reset” was the Russian “peregruzka,” which
                  wrongly meant “overload”—the opposite of the
                  meaning they were trying to convey (overload of
                  tensions is never good), as Lavrov was quick to
                  point out.
                  <span class="break"></span>
                  The correct word for “reset” in Russian required
                  an extra syllable: “perezagruzka.” If only the
                  resources of the State Department had thought
                  to first check the translation with a Russian
                  expert!

                  Interpretation is a series of details and nuances
                  that add up to a larger meaning such that you can
                  barely notice the subtleties when it’s right, but
                  you’ll sure notice when it’s missing. It pays to get
                  the details right, especially for something as
                  fickle as language. Hire a good interpreter, one
                  who will be on your side and get across not just
                  your literal meaning, but your intention.

                      In the early 1990’s, prospects were good
                      for the growth of tourism and
                      investment in Yunnan, a province with
                      unique ethnicities and bountiful nature
                      in Southwest China. The Roaring Dragon
                      at that time was a well-known
                      40-year-old four-star hotel, one of the
                      first in the region, owned by the
                      provincial government and managed by
                      local Chinese.
                      <span class="break"></span>
                      But as a state-owned enterprise, their close to
                      700 staff lacked motivation since steady salaries
                      would be paid for by the government in any case,
                      and even though the hotel was still profitable,
                      the government thought it wasn’t meeting its
                      potential.
                      <span class="break"></span>
                      And so the government contracted foreign
                      management companies to take over:
                      One takeover in 1993 lost them nine million
                      RMB in a year.
                      The second one in 1999, by an international
                      hotel brand named Nothill, lost more than ten
                      million RMB in less than four months, with hotel
                      capacity nearing empty towards the end.
                      <span class="break"></span>
                      In between these two periods, when Chinese
                      management retook the system, the hotel did
                      well again. It was clear that the foreign
                      management did have better standards of
                      services and more high-class hotel experience.
                      But their international reputation did nothing to
                      attract visitors; in fact, it sometimes seemed
                      arrogant.
                      <span class="break"></span>
                      Both times, foreign-educated managers
                      neglected the Chinese element of guanxi, or
                      connections. These connections always came
                      with a price: they were relationships of “you help
                      me, I help you.” Giving discounts to friends in
                      tour agencies meant they would bring their
                      groups to you. Hosting banquets in honor of
                      government officials meant you could pass
                      through bureaucratic processes much more
                      smoothly. Hiring your friends or relatives meant
                      they owed you something. The regular up-dating
                      of these guanxi—meals, tea, gifts, even leisurely
                      chats over nothing—were essential for
                      relationship maintenance of mutual benefit..

                    <p class="content">
                      Guanxi is effective, but it is not always efficient.
                      Foreign managers at the Roaring Dragon saw it
                      simply as favoritism or nepotism; they banned
                      discounts, hiring based on connections, and
                      other incentives based on guanxi. Once, a
                      foreign F&B manager outright refused a tour
                      group a banquet because he deemed it too
                      cheap. The tour agency, which another Chinese
                      manager had carefully cultivated guanxi with and
                      which often booked large groups into the hotel,
                      never booked tour groups in the hotel again. The
                      guanxi was ruined, and the agent left to a
                      competitor. Government officials were no longer
                      given star treatment and discounts, so they left,
                      too.
                      <span class="break"></span>
                      Employees also complained that “the foreign
                      management did not know the Chinese way”:
                      they were no longer allowed to take long breaks,
                      to invite their friends to the hotel for no reason,
                      even to eat with each other as per new schedules.
                      Long-time employees who were made redundant
                      complained of not being treated with respect,
                      since they were being laid off and paid on a single
                      day without prior notice. Employee morale had
                      depressed so much that even if they were not
                      made redundant under new policies, many
                      high-level employees left of their own accord,
                      oftentimes with years of guanxi.
                      <span class="break"></span>
                      Guanxi, because it is so personal, is something
                      that is not transferable. In their quest to make
                      everything more efficient, foreign managers had
                      actually lost the very business and people they
                      sought to attract.

                      Interpretation is a series of details and nuances
                      that add up to a larger meaning such that you can
                      barely notice the subtleties when it’s right, but
                      you’ll sure notice when it’s missing. It pays to get
                      the details right, especially for something as
                      fickle as language. Hire a good interpreter, one
                      who will be on your side and get across not just
                      your literal meaning, but your intention.

                      The Lithuanian Minister of Culture visited
                      Shanghai
                      to
                      discuss
                      cooperation
                      with
                      representatives of five major Chinese cultural
                      stakeholders, including Shanghai vice-mayor

                      Lina served as a diplomatic interpreter between
                      the two cultural delegations in a series of
                      meetings, both formal and informal, in 2016.

                    <p class="content">
                      The Lithuanian cultural delegation included not
                      just the Minister of Culture, but also the heads
                      of Lithuanian national ballet, opera, theater, and
                      art galleries. Shanghai as a major metropolis has
                      its choice of international arts productions, so
                      any potential collaborations would be based on a
                      sense of rapport and camaraderie.
                      <span class="break"></span>
                      In fact, this was why Lina was there: to show that
                      a native Lithuanian could speak high-level
                      Chinese as a nod of cultural respect. Since
                      direct Lithuanian-Chinese professional interpreters
                      are rare, most delegations communicate
                      through the common medium of English. The
                      Chinese side had English translators in place,
                      but as this was a meeting of cultural
                      stakeholders, it seemed essential to allow the
                      Lithuanians as well, especially the cultural
                      minister, to speak directly from their culture:
                      their language.
                      <span class="break"></span>
                      Prior to the meetings, we had already
                      researched the delegation’s communication
                      points along with the latest cultural trends in
                      Shanghai and Lithuania, learned the finer points
                      of diplomatic versus informal language, and
                      dove into the details of each meeting
                      participant’s background to be ready to address
                      each one with the proper respect and title.

                      By allowing the Lithuanian minister and Chinese
                      vice-mayor to both speak their native tongues,
                      by having a Lithuanian to translate into fluent
                      high-level Chinese and vice versa—LITAO
                      enabled both sides to pay the ultimate cultural
                      respect. In 2016, China has become the largest
                      market of Lithuanian cultural products,
                      especially theater.

                      Cultural collaborations between countries take
                      years in the making, but they all start with the
                      mutual respect and friendship laid in place here.
                      Even the formal meetings had a friendly tone, as
                      Lina explained beyond the meanings of official
                      statements to relate to each country’s culture.
                      The Lithuanian Minister of Culture himself
                      commented, “it is a luxury to have an interpreter

                    Flintas, a Lithuanian children’s books publisher,
                    was entering the China International Children’s
                    Book Fair in Shanghai for the first time. Though
                    a thriving publisher in its home country, it didn’t
                    know any of the requirements for China’s strict
                    censorship laws and differentiations between
                    publishers. LITAO was hired prior to and during
                    the exhibition to prepare Flintas’ offerings and

                    We first sorted through the publisher’s hundreds
                    of titles to determine what would work best,
                    settling on a total of twelve books marketed to
                    children up to five years old. The age limit itself
                    was a strategic move: the more illustrations and
                    fewer words, the less there would be to censor.
                    We also focused on titles with immediate
                    positive utility, such as books that improved
                    children’s hand mobility.
                    <span class="break"></span>
                    At the exhibition itself, we had to keep alert for
                    proper matches—offiicial publishing house
                    acquirers who would buy the books’ copyrights
                    for China and NOT undercover creative
                    directors who would copy the Lithuanian books’
                    innovative educational methods. As such, we
                    had to be very selective with the information we
                    gave away, filtering through layers of
                    conversation to discover the true roles of the
                    various inquirers.

                    Chinese
                    manufacturers and deliverers often try to dupe
                    foreigners by stating “such and such is Chinese
                    law”: things like requiring the foreign company
                    to transfer IP ownership or enter into exclusive
                    distribution arrangeemtns with Chinese
                    companies.
                    <span class="break"></span>
                    There are no such laws for IP transfer or
                    exclusivity requirements! In fact, it is extremely
                    important not to enter into exclusivity
                    arrangements with a distributor/marketer/seller
                    because even if they are very good in one region
                    of China, they may not be in another.
                    <span class="break"></span>
                    In addition, if they have an exclusivity
                    agreement with you, it is possible they have
                    another agreement with a competitor company.
                    They may simply choose not to sell your product
                    so the other one doesn’t suffer from the
                    competition, and because you signed X years of
                    exclusivity, there is nothing you can do.
                    <span class="break"></span>
                    Exclusive distribution is part of what led
                    Hershey’s down the hole in China: its sales in
                    2015 were USD 90 million less than the
                    projected USD 200 million, mostly because it
                    had acquired a local candy maker company
                    called Shanghai Golden Monkey to expand its
                    local distributor network. But the distributor
                    and customer network was not as broad or as
                    stable as they had believed—and since they had
                    spent USD 584 million acquiring the company,
                    they were stuck with them.

                    So you’ve got a trusted supplier with a good
                    agreement. The initial production samples look
                    good. But how can you insure they stay good?
                    Quality fade—what happens when manufacturers
                    go for wider margins by reducing product
                    quality—happens gradually and often without
                    notice.
                    <span class="break"></span>
                    An American company that designed and
                    patented alumninum building support systems
                    supplied their parts from China. Since these
                    support systems were used to construct
                    high-rise buildings, they had sophisticated
                    measurements for each part of the system; not
                    having the right engineering specifications
                    meant compromising building stability. But the
                    Chinese supplier reduced the specifications
                    anyway, until more than 10% of the aluminum
                    weight was missing.
                    <span class="break"></span>
                    There is little that foreign companies can do
                    even if they catch the supplier. If they recall a
                    product, it is done in their country—after having
                    paid full prices before the product left China.
                    Since supplier relationships are so difficult to
                    find and foster in the first place, it is difficult to
                    switch, and other suppliers may do the same.
                    Supplier information is often kept as trade
                    secrets, so it’s also hard to know by reputation.
                    <span class="break"></span>
                    And when quality goes bad, it can tarnish not
                    only your local but international reputation, as
                    happened with McDonald’s and Yum Brand’s
                    KFC, after a TV program revealed their Chinese
                    supplier, Shanghai Husi Food Co., mixing in
                    expired meat.

                    Even quality changes that may not seem like a big
                    deal can accumulate over time. When quality
                    issues are at hand, the hidden manufacturers
                    don’t bear the burdens. The negative
                    repercussions fall on the company who trusted
                    those suppliers, so do your QC constantly and
                    vigilantly.

                    And even if your manufacturers are good,
                    consider your distributors carefully, especially if
                    you have a specialty product. Consider luxury
                    ice cream brand Haagen-Dasz, well-known for
                    dominating a Chinese market at a time when the
                    country didn’t even eat much dairy. Since China
                    was so inexperienced with dairy, it didn’t trust
                    local manufacturers and imported all its ice
                    cream from abroad—but then it went a step
                    further.
                    <span class="break"></span>
                    Haagen-Dasz products do best at a constant
                    temperature of -26 degrees Celsius, a lower
                    temperature than most ice creams, and market
                    research found that Chinese freezers wouldn’t
                    be cold or constant enough. So the company
                    invested in its own specially-refrigerated trucks
                    to do all the distribution. Later on, not counting
                    its own stores, it installed 5,000 specialty
                    freezers at supermarkets that sold its products.
                    <span class="break"></span>
                    For a brand that promised quality, this was the
                    ultimate guarantee.

                    and consumers, don’t forget about the
                    middleman: the distributor. If you have a product
                    that needs to be taken care of in some way to be
                    in its ultimate best state, your distributor will

                    An individual businessman sought to launch a
                    private-label insulated coffee thermos to be sold
                    on Amazon, with all production taking place in
                    China. He had the brand, but needed quality
                    manufacturing at European standards, not
                    something China is known for.
                  </p>
                  <h5 class="content_title_approach">The LITAO Approach:</h5>
                  <p class="content">
                    Rigorous and systematic quality control was the
                    biggest focus. We provided three best options of
                    known direct suppliers; working with the
                    manufacturers
                    themselves—not
                    resellers—allowed us to control production
                    outcomes.
                    <span class="break"></span>
                    In Europe, manufacturers are expected to
                    comply with 100% of company requests, but in
                    China, standards are often relaxed and products
                    turn out in slightly different colors or even sizes;
                    factories sometimes even start using different
                    materials without informing the client. This
                    might be okay for Chinese wholesalers, but not
                    for us.
                    <span class="break"></span>
                    Even after ordering samples and choosing a
                    manufacturer, we hired a QC supervisor from
                    Shanghai to go personally to the factories each
                    week. Check-in points were implemented in all
                    stages
                    of
                    production:
                    samples
                    during
                    manufacturing, full QC pre-shipment, and
                    supervision while loading—all while keeping to
                    production schedule.

                  <p class="content">
                    For this product, we filtered up to 2% of goods
                    produced with quality issues—including a batch
                    with a misprinted logo—and pressured the
                    factory into producing proper ones in only a few
                    hours to make a shipment dead-line. Only
                    careful vetting would ensure such fast and
                    accurate turnaround. The client continues to
                    order new batches, with sales profitable from the
                    3rd quarter and increasing. His line of production
                    now includes not just a coffee thermos in various
                    colors but also a glass bottle and a flask, all
                    thoroughly QC-ed; other products are in

                    GroupOn dominates much of the
                    international market, but not China,
                    despite entering with millions in
                    investments and prominent Chinese
                    partners.
                    <span class="break"></span>
                    This was mostly a failure in long-term strategic
                    thinking from the beginning: a strategy that
                    sought to fit China to GroupOn’s international
                    model instead of the other way around. Instead
                    of using local expertise, GroupOn hired almost
                    all-foreigner business school grads as top
                    management (only two people on its senior
                    management team were Chinese, and one was
                    from Hong Kong). The company expected it
                    could use the same strategy it did in Germany to
                    poach salespeople from competitor companies
                    via high salaries, but Chinese group-buying sites
                    made an alliance such that if their employee left
                    to work for GroupOn, they would no longer be
                    able to work in the future in the Chinese
                    alliance.
                    <span class="break"></span>
                    It had looked rosy at the beginning: GroupOn
                    was in league with two of China’s biggest tech
                    companies, especially a 40% stake from Tencent
                    (parent of the now-ubiquitous WeChat) and a
                    smaller stake including Alibaba. But a
                    non-compete clause was not included in their
                    agreement, and both tech companies had
                    investments in other Chinese group buying
                    companies that ended up doing much better.
                    <span class="break"></span>
                    GroupOn needed Tencent to operate in China
                    much more than Tencent needed GroupOn for a
                    group buying web-site, of which many already
                    existed in China. GroupOn was even surprised
                    when Lashou, China’s largest group-buying site,
                    refused its huge offer to buy them. Simply
                    having cash and latching on to large Chinese
                    companies with conflicting interests is not a
                    good localization strategy. This led to $46
                    million in net losses with only $2.1 million
                    revenues within its first three quarters, and it
                    has never recovered.

                    After a massive earthquake hit western China in
                    2008, Nestlé donated 10 million yuan—no
                    strings—to disaster relief. When the melamine
                    tainted milk scandal hit China, Nestle had
                    already planted seeds twenty years earlier for
                    quality milk: having fostered trust by hiring
                    Swiss experts to train their local cow farmers
                    and paving roads in a rural area for milk

                    Not all companies have resources like

                    and the middle people who make it all happen. It
                    doesn’t happen in a day; fostering local
                    relationships and caring about the areas in
                    which you work takes time and shows the locals
                    how native you can go.

          If you’re really going for the long haul,
          consider this deep-rooted strategy
          businesswoman Chin-Ning Chu used, as
          discussed in her best-seller book on
          business in China, “Thick Face, Black
          Heart”:
          <span class="break"></span>
          This was back in the early 1980’s, and her client
          was a US grass seed manufacturer from the
          state of Oregon—a top grass-seed-producing
          region in the world, fulfilling 50% of the world’s
          demands—that was determined to sell to China.
          But to the Chinese, grass was a weed and
          needed to be pulled out; to call someone “grass”
          was an insult, and for years, the Chinese
          refused—until Chu took the case.
          <span class="break"></span>
          At the time, foreign currency was restricted and
          difficult to exchange from the Chinese yuan, so
          Chu proposed to Chinese officials that an
          American company wanted to produce seeds in
          China and buy them back in US currency at the
          same price they paid American farmers. She
          made sure to mention that the foreigners were
          naive, a position that many Chinese already
          thought, so they were highly pleased with the
          proposal.
          <span class="break"></span>
          Of course, China could not create quality grass
          seed with no experience; this was what the
          businesswoman considered “deception without
          deceit.” For alongside American grass seed
          experts, she visited China frequently and taught
          the Chinese how to produce quality grass seed
          as well as its final flourishing, the lawn.
          <span class="break"></span>
          The Chinese realized after a few years that the
          costs of producing grass seed of a certain
          quality were too great, but the side effect was
          that they had learned how to value grass, and
          specifically, American grass. They began to buy
          seed directly from the US company and used it
          to great effect in the 1990 Asian games. After
          the Asian Olympics, grass seed became more
          popular than ever, selling at over five times the
          price sold in the U.S. Nowadays in China, even in
          space-tight cities, lawns in public arenas,
          private homes, and even the estates of
          prominent officials likely come from Oregon.

          For this product, we filtered up to 2% of goods
          produced with quality issues—including a batch
          with a misprinted logo—and pressured the
          factory into producing proper ones in only a few
          hours to make a shipment dead-line. Only
          careful vetting would ensure such fast and
          accurate turnaround. The client continues to
          order new batches, with sales profitable from the
          3rd quarter and increasing. His line of production
          now includes not just a coffee thermos in various
          colors but also a glass bottle and a flask, all

        A European FMCG distributor is among the
        largest in its country. It has over a decade of
        experience sourcing from China and selling in
        the West. But now it wants to reverse the flow
        and build a retail supermarket chain in mainland
        China itself. They approached LITAO for a
        localized China market entry strategy but did
        not know where in China they wanted to start.
      </p>
      <h5 class="content_title_approach">The LITAO Approach:</h5>
      <p class="content">
        As a European company, they operated at home
        with access to a broad range of data—corporate
        KPIs, K performance indices, best-selling
        supermarket SKUs—to calculate investments
        and ROI and make other strategic decisions. But
        this approach doesn’t work for foreign
        companies in China, where information is
        classified and protected by the China chain
        store association. Nielsen has access to this
        data, but the costs are exorbitant. Instead of
        quantitative data, we were able to obtain
        interviews with experts and KOLs for
        consumer-based insights on product demand via
        geographical location and demographics.
        <span class="break"></span>
        We realized in the course of this research that
        supermarkets are not very viable options in the
        first place; as on-line shopping has become
        more popular, large supermarkets that one must
        travel to through requisite traffic jams are
        becoming defunct. Localized grocery stores
        would be a better plan, but the company needs
        to first focus on a particular region in China and
        expand from that local area. We often tell our
        clients, “There is no such thing as a singular
        China.” After all, there are 23 provinces, each
        with their own cultures and traditions, over 200
        languages, and first-to-fourth tier cities.

        We helped the client adjust their China mainland
        market entry strategy to include more O2O
        instead of slowly decaying brick-and-mortar
        stores. They are realizing there truly is not one
        China, since people in this country have more
        regionally-based differences in consumer
        shopping habits than people in any other country
        in the world. The company is now focusing on
        selecting a narrower target audience to truly
        understand a local customer and sell them not
        only products, but a lifestyle—the only viable way
        to win in the age of Internet shopping.

          A premium European water brand with their own
          purification technology was looking to sell to
          China, but didn’t know where to start as the
          Chinese market is saturated with water suppliers
          and skeptical distributors, given the country’s
          history of water quality scandals. We helped the
          company find their unique pitch for potential
          B2B China partners while protecting their
          intellectual property and international brand
          equity.
        </p>
        <h5 class="content_title_approach">The LITAO Approach:</h5>
        <p class="content">
          We knew there was an opportunity in China, as
          data trends from Zenith International and
          Euromonitor showed bottled water consumption
          would likely double in the next five years. Our
          client wanted to enter the market right away,
          yet we warned them from doing so while their
          technology and trademark were not yet
          protected.
          <span class="break"></span>
          We focused instead on finding their brand
          positioning in China, first determining and
          analyzing best-selling Chinese and foreign
          water brands, especially independent or
          boutique brands similar to our client. We
          focused on five most relevant brands, two local
          and three foreign, to study in detail, and offered
          insights on how to differentiate from them and
          other competitors with value-added points
          (other than being from Europe!) and build a
          good brand and visual identity.
          <span class="break"></span>
          By building a strong brand presence prior to
          coming to China, they would be much more
          protected from brand imitators.

        <p class="content">
          We prevented the client from coming to China
          too early—a time when their water purification
          methods weren’t patented and their trademark
          wasn’t protected in either China or abroad. While
          the branding and patent process is ongoing, the
          company has entered negotiations with LITAO to
          serve as their official China agent once the
          protection pulls through.

            push
            from
            the
            Chinese
            government, the RMB is becoming
            increasingly internationalized. But it will
            still take a number of years before it
            shares equal status with the dollar, the
            euro, the pound, and the yen.
            <span class="break"></span>
            Most EU and US banks won’t accept RMB, so
            the money has to be transferred to Hong Kong
            and converted. Getting money out of and to
            China also takes some maneuvering because
            Chinese, both individuals and companies,
            popularly use mobile payments on WeChat and
            Alipay—like Paypal for the Western world, but
            even larger in scope.
            <span class="break"></span>
            The Chinese government is also making it more
            difficult to move money out of China via large
            corporate transactions, as many of China’s
            uber-rich use corporate buys as a cover to move
            cash into overseas banks and real estate
            (Chinese individuals are only allowed to send up
            to USD 50,000 overseas per year). Transfers
            are subject to scrutiny by the Chinese
            government, which has been tightening since
            the beginning of 2016, and can cause real time
            lags in foreign companies getting the necessary
            funds. If you don’t know who to contact or how
            to prove your legitimacy, you may not be in
            trouble but you’ll certainly be delayed.

            With the RMB yet to be completely
            internationalized and many Chinese using local
            payment schemes, it’s important to know how to
            get legally paid with the least amount of hassle
            and fees in your home country. In recent years,
            as more of China’s wealth boom moves overseas,
            the Chinese government is also making it more
            difficult for money to move out of China, with
            even legitimate transfers subject to scrutiny.

            Another thing to watch out for is financial fraud,
            something even the Chinese government has
            trouble controlling. A typical scam involves a
            regular Chinese supplier who asks you to make
            payments to a new bank account. Yet after you
            pay, your supplier says you still owe it the full
            amount, often with late fees, because it never
            received your payment.
            <span class="break"></span>
            This scam can happen to the most experienced
            of companies, even to toy manufacturer Mattel,
            whose executives wired over USD 3 million to
            China’s Bank of Wenzhou after a fake e-mail
            which claimed to hold orders from the company
            president.
            <span class="break"></span>
            Mattel acted quickly, alerting the FBI and
            Chinese authorities, and eventually got their
            money back, but most companies have no such
            luck. Sometimes they might convince the
            Chinese supplier to cover some of the costs—as
            it was their computer system that was
            compromised—but it depends on your supplier
            relationship.
            <span class="break"></span>
            We recommend double-checking everything
            and putting in safety precautions like confirming
            payments on land line phone numbers which are
            much harder to hack, getting the supplier’s bank
            account information in advance, and having an
            internal corporate check system before large
            payments.
            <span class="break"></span>
            Your Chinese suppliers will also understand, and
            perhaps even appreciate, the efforts you make
            for safety as they too lose out on scams.

            Even huge experienced companies can fall to the

            A frozen meat trading company in Europe
            wished to enter the China market with zero prior
            presence in China. LITAO’s role was to
            essentially create this presence—to create an
            image of trust to drive sales.
          </p>
          <h5 class="content_title_approach">The LITAO Approach:</h5>
          <p class="content">
            The company’s biggest setback was their lack of
            reputation in China. As traders, their
            competitors include other companies who trade
            the same products as well as producers who sell
            them in China directly. And who would buy from
            an unknown company when they could get the
            same products with a familiar one?
            <span class="break"></span>
            LITAO purchased data from Chinese customs
            on the biggest importers of best-performing
            meat products in China and contacted their
            sales and managers one by one to research best
            practices. Prior to representing the company at
            the SIAL Shanghai food exhibition, we
            developed various sales leads, registered and
            implemented a corporate WeChat Official
            Account for branding, set up a virtual office and
            data management system, and hired and trained
            loyal sales staff.
            <span class="break"></span>
            We knew our target clients were up-and-coming
            and relatively inexperienced Chinese sellers and
            importers, not huge established companies with
            their own networks, so we focused on selling to
            smaller companies. This meant targeting clients
            who did not speak English, who wanted easier
            cross-border payment solutions including
            WeChat and Alipay, who needed more
            explanations; we even provided them with
            B2B2C advice so they could market products
            better to their own consumers.

            The other risk with emerging companies, as

            but
            through
            constant

            In 2008, it was years of sector specialization
            and research that allowed a local Chinese
            detergent brand called Blue Moon to succeed in
            breaking into a Chinese market dominated by
            Unilever, Proctor & Gamble, and other
            multinational companies. The smaller company
            succeeded because it noticed something about
            the laundry detergent sector that the big
            companies missed.
            <span class="break"></span>
            While the multinationals focused on new
            products for washing machines, Blue Moon
            realized a significant portion of the Chinese
            population was more traditional and still
            hand-washed their clothes. Laundry powder was
            available for hand-washing clothes, but Blue
            Moon introduced a liquid hand-washing
            detergent that provided a better experience (no
            clumping!). Even after the other companies
            caught up, Blue Moon had snagged a steady
            30% of the liquid detergent market.
            <span class="break"></span>
            That’s what happens when you combine cultural
            sensitivity with careful observation of industry
            trends. Of course, it helped that they were
            backed by one of Asia’s top hedge funds,
            Hillhouse Capital, which makes investments and
            gives advice to Chinese start-ups.
            <span class="break"></span>
            But even after their initial success, the company
            didn’t stop their momentum. They continued to
            launch the detergent that worked, focusing on
            their best-selling SKU instead of branching into
            various new detergents.
            <span class="break"></span>
            Instead, they spent money on research and
            marketing. In 2011, a full three years after they
            sucessfully broke into the market, they spent
            USD 500 million alone for advertising. Their
            executives also met with a team from JD.com,
            one of China’s largest on-line marketplaces, to
            find ways to make the delivery process more
            efficient; they redesigned their detergent
            carton to fit with JD’s online delivery boxes.

          <p class="content">
            In 2012, they cut advertising but then hired
            salespeople to directly interact with customers in
            supermarkets, asking them to sample-smell
            patches of the detergent as if it were a perfume
            in a department store. They were constantly
            trying new strategies to present themselves not
            as the most affordable in their industry but
            instead “different and desirable.”

            Even small brands can beat huge multinationals,
            as long as they understand their particular
            consumers’ needs more than their competitors.
            Blue Moon proved that with its breakthrough
            liquid laundry detergent for the segment of
            Chinese population that still hand-washed
            clothes. It solved a problem that no other
            company solved for these people, and they won
            loyal customers. Even after initial success
            though, Blue Moon didn’t stop R&D and
            marketing: they kept striving to know more and
            to show it.

            A UK-based bespoke diamond ring brand, Rare
            Pink, wanted to expand to China. 90% of the
            brand’s rings are sold as engagement rings, but
            the whole matter of engagement has different
            cultural
            implications
            here.
            The
            brand
            approached us prior to meeting an important
            potential Chinese partner and investor.

            We knew what they really needed was a strong
            pitch to make their case for this investor. And all
            investors are looking for not just good products
            but strong opportunities.
            <span class="break"></span>
            We found that compared to the U.S. market
            which preferred 0.8ct to 1ct diamonds, the
            Chinese market up to now showed preferences
            for smaller 0.3 to 0.7ct diamonds. With China’s
            growing per capita GDP, this demonstrated
            potential for average diamond order values to
            also increase. Desk research yielded many
            interesting insights, and we soon had a
            consumer focus, investment plan, and target
            revenues.
            <span class="break"></span>
            Yet how could the brand itself show off their
            China knowledge without having any experience
            in the Chinese market? LITAO arranged a series
            of mystery shopping visits in Shanghai for the
            company CEO and a selected female
            companion, who pretended to be his fiancee.
            Through our strategically-designed questions,
            they learned from jewelers firsthand what
            designs sold best in their stores (Chinese had
            more desire for colored diamonds(?)); how
            stores were set up (I forget?); and how
            salespeople provided service (with Chinese
            couples being generally more reticent about
            their impending engagement).

            They left with a 10-page MOU and full business
            proposal with both research and firsthand
            insights, which allowed the Chinese investor to
            take them seriously. They are still discussing the
            details.

            Viciunai Group, the biggest surimi manufacturer
            in Europe and among the top five in the world
            (producing 160,000 tons of food products each
            year), wanted to globalize even further. But how
            could it enter China with its strict food import
            regulations?

            China itself is the world’s largest producer of
            surimi and other fish products, and Chinese
            import regulations over the past decades have
            grown ever stricter to protect local interests, to
            the point where quality inspection for products
            coming in have specifications more rigid and
            exacting than those of the EU—this despite
            notoriously low in-country food standards.
            <span class="break"></span>
            Unless a product has been historically imported
            and thus deemed acceptable, it is almost
            impossible to enter China. We informed the
            company of the regulations beforehand. We
            then researched fish from Lithuania that had
            previously been allowed to enter China, limiting
            the company to a stock of six.
            <span class="break"></span>
            This meant changing their surimi formula as they
            were limited to work from a stock of six
            “allowed” fishes.

            The company hired us as their official Greater
            China agent as their products continue to move
            into production in accordance with Chinese
            import restrictions, regulations they would never
            have passed with their existing products.

            We did more than help Viciunai Group import
            their products; we changed their whole approach
            to marketing. Read about how we helped the
