                                <p> <b>China in the 21st century</b> is an emergent <b>superpower</b> still catching up to its own strength, an authoritative <b>bureaucracy</b> in the midst of <b>organizing chaos</b>—though it’s already a strong player on the world stage, it still has <b>ample room to grow.</b> <span class="break"></span> China has been the <b>world’s second largest economy</b> by GDP since 2010, when it surpassed Japan. When GDP is adjusted for Purchasing Power Parity, though, China is <b>officially the world’s largest economy</b>, according to the International Monetary Fund—meaning the country’s consumers have <b>more individual purchasing power</b> than anywhere else in the world. And there are a LOT of consumers: <b>one out of every five people in the world is Chinese.</b> <span class="break"></span> You may have been hearing that China’s current GDP growth is the <b>lowest it’s been in decades</b> (2016’s was 6.7%). But that’s only in comparison to its average growth rate of <b>10% per year</b> since economic reforms in 1978; it’s still doing extremely well in real terms (the U.S. GDP growth for 2016 was less than half of China’s). Slowing down is part of a natural process after so much <b>rapid growth.</b> <span class="break"></span> Much of the slowdown also has to do with <b>China’s shift</b> from being a cheap manufacturer of goods (now that goes to countries like Vietnam or Mexico) to more of a major consumer with <b>a huge and rapidly growing middle class.</b> According to the 2015 Credit Suisse wealth report, <b>China has a larger middle-class adult population than the United States.</b> <span class="break"></span> <a href="https://www.credit-suisse.com/us/en/about-us/research/research-institute/news-and-videos/articles/news-and-expertise/2015/10/en/global-wealth-in-2015-underlying-trends-remain-positive.html" class="color-red" target="blank">Read more: Global Wealth in 2015: Underlying Trends Remain Positive </a> <span class="break"></span> With such a large sector of new potential consumers, China is really one of the most important countries in the world right now in business as well as politics. </p>

                                <p> Related to the above answer, <b>a huge emergent middle class</b>—the largest in the world now—means also <b>middle class values</b>. Western companies used to only target China’s uber-rich (China DOES have a lot of millionaires); but Chinese clients are now much more diverse, and no longer only in coastal cities. <span class="break"></span> So what do Chinese people want? First, <b>there’s no one China or Chinese person</b>: it’s a huge country with distinct regions and regional preferences. <span class="break"></span> China—with its <b>35 distinct administrative regions</b>, <b>56 officially-recognized ethnicities</b>, and <b>over 200 mutually unintelligible dialects</b>—is as complex a country as you can get. <span class="break"></span> The <b>differences in consumer appetite</b> between one region of China and another are comparable to <b>differences between countries</b> elsewhere, not to mention the differences between Tier-1 cities (Beijing, Shanghai) and Tier-3 (Ziyang, Leshan). You really have to know who you’re targeting. <span class="break"></span> But there are certain <b>trends we can count on.</b> <span class="break"></span> According to <b>McKinsey’s 2016 China Consumer Report</b>, which surveyed 10,000 consumers across 44 cities in China, one huge trend that is already underway but will keep growing is the shift from mass market products to premium. <span class="break"></span> <a href="http://www.mckinsey.com/industries/retail/our-insights/here-comes-the-modern-chinese-consumer" class="color-red" target="blank">Read more: Here comes the modern Chinese consumer</a> <span class="break"></span> <img src="home-images/crossing_cultures/graph.jpg" class="img-fluid graph"> <span class="break"></span> Local brands will always best foreign ones for the mass market share, but <b>Chinese brands aren’t always as trusted for premium products</b>, especially for cosmetics and health. 38% of surveyed consumers listed “organic/green food” as among their top three criteria—even though China itself doesn’t have a credible organic certification, meaning foreign certifications are <b>more important</b> than ever. <span class="break"></span> China’s consumers are also <b>growing younger</b>, and as such, more Westernized than ever before. They check <b>on-line reviews</b>and are more likely <b>to try new things</b>—including specialized items like laundry softeners, unused by their predecessors. <span class="break"></span> <a href="http://www.mckinsey.com/industries/retail/our-insights/mapping-chinas-middle-class" target="blank" class="color-red">Read more: Mapping China's middle class</a> <span class="break"></span> Consumer strategies that used to work—appealing to a wide range of people with a standardized product—don’t anymore. Chinese people are becoming <b>much more particular</b> with what they like or not, and strategies need to be <b>tailor-made</b>—but the good thing is that compared to previous generations, they spend a <b>higher percentage</b> of their earnings—so if they <b>really like something</b>, they won’t necessarily save for later. </p>

                                <p> Unless your product truly has <b>incredible margins</b> (that locals would take advantage of at which would be a loss to you), the Chinese really prefer working with people who <b>understand China and Chinese.</b> You need someone <b>Chinese-savvy</b> by your side to navigate the market. Even simple things like money transfer and payment expectations differ in China. If you can’t <b>establish yourself permanently</b> in China, you’ll need someone suppliers and distributors can reach easily. You’ll also need to operate with on on a <b>whole different social media marketing scheme,</b> with China-specific mobile platforms (see <a href="#we-chat-id" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#r10" class="color-red">What is WeChat?</a>); traditional web-sites are not nearly as important in China as <b>mobile</b>. <span class="break"></span> On the <b>administrative side</b>, with China’s complicated and ever-evolving import/export regulations and labor laws, foreign companies are often left out of the loop <b>when the rules change</b>. For employees, the Chinese government <b>obligates employers</b> to file staff information with relevant bureaus, maintain files, and pay social benefits and taxes for their employees. So even if you decide to sell on your own, if you want any <b>legal Chinese employees</b>, you’ll need a labor agency. <span class="break"></span> Chinese regulations aren’t always by the book, either. Sometimes the official web-site says one thing, but <b>word-of-mouth</b> says another. Which one do you think works? If your product is not approved <b>despite thinking</b> you met all the requirements, it takes Chinese <b>connections and digging</b> to even understand why. <span class="break"></span>

                                <p> As local experts, consultants are your <b>modern-day guides and gurus</b>: part-lawyer, part-interpreter, part-coach. We are <b>problem-solvers</b> but also <b>problem-preventers</b>, with <b>culturally-sensitive solutions</b> to market research, relationship-building, and strategy. We make things clear for you to take the <b>next step</b>. <span class="break"></span> Consultants give <b>common sense</b> business advice, backed up by first-hand research, experience, and connections. Here at LITAO, though, we do more than give advice: we actually help you <b>implement</b> our suggestions. <span class="break"></span> A China consultant is a <b>hands-on</b> guide for everything that doesn’t make sense in this country—<b>culturally</b>, <b>linguistically</b>, <b>logistically</b>, and <b>legally</b>. We’re different from company agents or representatives because we don’t just follow the <b>status quo</b> for business; we help you strategize for <b>long-term growth</b>. And while <b>interpretation</b> is one of our services, helping you understand the language and negotiate with business partners is only <b>one small part</b> of the services we provide. <span class="break"></span> All cultures have had their <b>advice-givers</b>: from shamans and medicine men to viziers and general counsels. <span class="break"></span> Shamans take information from other worlds to use in this one. Premiers and viziers counsel their heads of state. General counsels give legal advice from decades of litigation experience. All of them act as <b>intermediaries between experience and decision</b>. All of them help a tribe, country, or company become <b>better versions</b> of themselves. </p>

                                <p> “Language is not only how we <b>express our thoughts</b>, it is also how we <b>create our thoughts.</b>” —Chin-Ming Chu <span class="break"></span> We often hear clients say something like, “I don’t understand what this person’s answer is. I asked an <b>open-ended question</b> and he answered ‘yes.’” A lot of that comes down to <b>knowing how to ask the right question</b>. Not only is there a <b>language barrier</b>, sometimes the Chinese don’t understand your <b>specific standards</b>—“good enough” may well be satisfactory, and they may only want to assure you everything is alright even when it’s not—especially if they can <b>fool a newcomer</b>. Business negotiation means asking <b>specific, tailored questions</b> so the answerer cannot <b>escape into vagueness.</b> (Sometimes to avoid saying a direct “no” to a request, the Chinese will simply say “we’ll see” or delay.) You have to know the <b>key words</b> before you ask—this is where we can help. <span class="break"></span> The Chinese also don’t necessarily think in a <b>linear fashion</b>, so don’t always expect proposals to go from A to B to C or a business plan with a distributor to adhere strictly to dead-line. Doing business in China often means <b>going in circles</b>, many meetings just to get to know you; until the distributor <b>trusts you</b> (a.k.a. you are friendly, if not friends), business is not likely to happen. That’s why <b>guanxi</b> (below) are so important in China. Chinese businesspeople <b>who have worked with us in the past</b> know they can trust us, so they will <b>also trust you</b>. </p>

                                <p> Due diligence is really about making sure any company <b>is what it says it is.</b> This ranges from whether or not the company actually <b>exists</b> to whether they have <b>positive feedback</b>, <b>regular employees</b>, and <b>good finances</b>; in the course of our work, we’ve found fake <b>copy-cat companies</b> before with offshore accounts, or companies with web-sites and no manufacturing facilities, or even companies <b>borrowing</b> others’ offices. If you <b>don’t check first</b>, there is no way any court can get the money back for you. <b>Assume the worst to guarantee the best. LITAO once saved a company 30,000 EUR through noticing the company name on the invoice did not match the one they gave elsewhere.</b> <span class="break"></span> The above is financial or operational due diligence, and suppliers certified with the ISO (International Organization for Standardization) may be <b>qualified on paper</b>, but <b>real-time experience</b> and <b>word-of-mouth reputation</b> is even better. You need experienced people to verify if documents, including a business license, are <b>real</b>, as well as to be aware of common scams. <span class="break"></span> The <b>second kind</b> of due diligence actually happens AFTER you’ve found a supplier you want to work with. This is <b>factory-level product QC</b>, and again requires regular local visits to <b>ensure quality</b>; even if the first sample batches are okay, the factory may cut costs in the future so batches must be <b>checked regularly</b> pre-shipment to ensure product quality. </p>
