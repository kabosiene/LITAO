Russia had been 1/3 of its apple exports. To boost its apple trade, Poland applied for a <b>trade agreement to import apples to China</b> in August 2014. <span class="break"></span> Fresh vegetables and fruits are especially difficult to be approved for import to China; even though they usually have fewer risks of contamination, the Chinese government treated politically weighty fruit import with the <b>procedural caution usually reserved for animal products</b>. All grower hygiene methods and qualities had to be adjusted and inspected, and <b>each apple had to be traced back to its origins</b>. <span class="break"></span> The trade agreement was finalized <b>almost two years later</b> in June 2016—this after a series of inspections, meetings between the two country’s heads of states, and after the <b>Polish prime minister personally requested that the agreement be expedited</b>.

                                        <p class="content"> China differs from the EU, the US and most other countries in the world for having a <b>“first-to-file” trademark system</b>. <span class="break"></span> Companies like Apple have had to pay <b>millions of dollars</b> in court and settlement fees bcause Chinese companies can lay claim to patents even if they <b>weren’t the first</b> to develop a certain technology—as long as they were <b>first to USE them</b> in a Chinese market product. <span class="break"></span> In July 2012, <b>Apple paid $60 million</b> to a small vendor for ownership of the “iPad” trademark, which the local Chinese company had previously registered. This delayed the introduction of the iPad 2 in China. More recently, another little-known startup won a case against Apple’s iPhone 6 and 6 Plus based on a smartphone design patent. <span class="break"></span> Foreign companies often get <b>entangled in intellectual property battles</b> in China, where the courts protect local intellectual property rights and the sheer number of companies means <b>names aren’t guaranteed</b>. China filed <b>12.5% more patent applications</b> and <b>18.2% more trademark applications</b> in 2015 compared to the year before, and this number is only growing. The same goes for <b>domain names</b>; when Groupon tried to register as groupon.cn or groupon.com.cn, the names had already been registered by a copycat Chinese competitor, complete with the Groupon company name, logo, and site design. It could do nothing about the copying, and also had to use a much less recognizable domain. </p>

Starbucks researchers realized they could sell not the coffee as a product itself, but <b>an experience around it</b>. <span class="break"></span> They invested in <b>prime, central business locations</b>; leather armchairs, plush sofas, and other posh decor in a dimly lit environment; and outdoor seating with parasols for a European ambience. Businessmen could hold meetings in the private but bustling atmosphere; the status-conscious could sit and sip with their girlfriends in front of the large glass windows, taking selfies and hoping to be seen. <span class="break"></span> Coffee as a <b>status symbol of the West</b> was perfect for a country with a growing upper-middle class that loves conspicuous consumption. <b>Starbucks gave them more than a drink</b>; it gave them a certain enviable experience and lifestyle.

                                        <p class="content"> Everyone knows brand names and logos are important, but with Chinese social media famous for puns they can make out of various homonyms, the Chinese versions can truly <b>make or break you</b>. <span class="break"></span> Creating a great brand name is not only a <b>powerful marketing tool</b>; if you don’t create it, you <b>might not like</b> what the Chinese consumers call it in its place. Two famous trademarks that did not make Chinese versions of their brand before entering the market met this fate. Chinese found it difficult to pronounce the phonetics of their foreign names in Chinese, so they called them by their logos: <b>Quaker Oatmeal</b> thus became “Lao Ren Pai,” which translates to “Old Man Brand,” and <b>Ralph Lauren</b> became “Three-Legged Horse.” <b>Not exactly sexy branding.</b> <span class="break"></span> Meanwhile, <b>Coca-cola</b> is an early example of good branding at work; it was first sold in China in 1927, but local shopkeepers couldn’t figure out what to call it in China. They tried to find Chinese characters that sounded close to the name, coming up with a <b>pool of 200 or so characters</b>. But the names the shopkeepers came up with had strange definitions: though they were phonetically similar, the meanings varied from “female horse fastened with wax” to “bite the wax tadpole.” <span class="break"></span> It was only <b>a year later</b> that Coca-Cola employees finally registered its current name: a combination of characters that means “<b>to permit mouth to be able to rejoice</b>”—a huge step up from horses and tadpoles. </p>

In fact, Fortune Magazine has named interpreter Zhang Lu as one of the “ <b>world’s most powerful women.</b>” <span class="break"></span> She serves as the voice of <b>China’s top leaders</b>, including Premier Li Keqiang. In diplomatic situations, the interpreter’s voice stands as the <b>voice of authority</b>, and any deviation from both meaning and tone is an indictment on the <b>nation itself</b>. <span class="break"></span> The <b>U.S. Department of State</b> had to learn this the hard way. When then-U.S. Secretary of State <b>Hillary Clinton</b> met Russian Foreign Minister <b>Sergei Lavrov</b> in 2009, she presented him a joke gift of a <b>mock “reset” button</b>—in symbolic honor of a <b>relationship reset</b> between the U.S. and Russia from tensions in the past. But the word the State Department chose for “reset” was the Russian “<b>peregruzka</b>,” which wrongly meant “<b>overload</b>”—the <b>opposite of the meaning they were trying to convey</b> (overload of tensions is never good), as Lavrov was quick to point out. <span class="break"></span> The correct word for “reset” in Russian required an <b>extra syllable</b>: “perezagruzka.” If only the resources of the State Department had thought to first <b>check the translation</b> with a Russian expert! </p>

                                        <p class="content"> In the early 1990’s, <b>prospects were good</b> for the growth of tourism and investment in <b>Yunnan</b>, a province with unique ethnicities and bountiful nature in Southwest China. <b>The Roaring Dragon</b> at that time was a well-known 40-year-old four-star hotel, one of the first in the region, owned by the provincial government and managed by local Chinese. <span class="break"></span> But as a <b>state-owned enterprise</b>, their close to 700 staff <b>lacked motivation</b> since steady salaries would be paid for by the government in any case, and even though the hotel was still profitable, the government thought it <b>wasn’t meeting its potential</b>. <span class="break"></span> And so the government contracted <b>foreign management companies</b> to take over: One takeover in 1993 lost them <b>nine million RMB</b> in a year. The second one in 1999, by another international hotel brand, lost more than <b>ten million RMB</b> in less than four months, with <b>hotel capacity nearing empty</b> towards the end. <span class="break"></span> In between these two periods, when Chinese management <b>retook the system</b>, the hotel did well again. It was clear that the foreign management did have better standards of services and more high-class hotel experience. But their <b>international reputation did nothing to attract visitors</b>; in fact, it sometimes seemed arrogant. <span class="break"></span> Both times, foreign-educated managers <b>neglected the Chinese element of guanxi</b>, or connections. These connections always came with a price: they were relationships of “<b>you help me, I help you</b>.” Giving <b>discounts</b> to friends in tour agencies meant they would bring their groups to you. Hosting <b>banquets</b> in honor of government officials meant you could pass through bureaucratic processes much more smoothly. <b>Hiring your friends or relatives</b> meant they owed you something. The regular up-dating of these guanxi—<b>meals, tea, gifts, even leisurely chats over nothing</b>—were essential for relationship maintenance of <b>mutual benefit</b>. </p>

                                        <p class="content"> <b>Guanxi is effective, but it is not always efficient.</b> Foreign managers at the Roaring Dragon saw it simply as <b>favoritism</b> or <b>nepotism</b>; they banned discounts, hiring based on connections, and other incentives based on guanxi. Once, a foreign F&B manager <b>outright refused</b> a tour group a banquet because he deemed it too cheap. The tour agency, which another Chinese manager had carefully cultivated guanxi with and which often booked large groups into the hotel, never booked tour groups in the hotel again. <b>The guanxi was ruined</b>, and the agent left to a competitor. Government officials were no longer given star treatment and discounts, so they left, too. <span class="break"></span> Employees also complained that “<b>the foreign management did not know the Chinese way</b>”: they were no longer allowed to take long breaks, to invite their friends to the hotel for no reason, even to eat with each other as per new schedules. Long-time employees who were made redundant complained of <b>not being treated with respect</b>, since they were being laid off and paid on a single day without prior notice. <b>Employee morale had depressed so much</b> that even if they were not made redundant under new policies, many high-level employees left of their own accord, oftentimes with years of guanxi. <span class="break"></span>
                                            <b>Guanxi, because it is so personal, is something that is not transferable</b>. In their quest to make everything more efficient, foreign managers had actually lost the very business and people they sought to attract. </p>

                                        <p class="content"> Guanxi are like the Chinese version of business networks, but wider-ranging and more informal. They make the carefully cultivated interdependent webs that much of Chinese business lives in. Guanxi is more than friendliness in China; it is how things can get done, through one favor or another. As foreign managers at the Roaring Dragon learned, don’t neglect guanxi for the sake of cold efficiency, because it may be more important than you think. People are the ones who answer the questions, place the orders, give you customers, and do the work in the end. <a href="http://mams.rmit.edu.au/3je3klf7vrprz.pdf" target="blank" class="color-red more">Read More</a> </p>

                                        <h5 class="content_title_approach">The LITAO Approach:</h5>
                                        <p class="content"> The Lithuanian cultural delegation included not just the <b>Minister of Culture</b>, but also the heads of <b>Lithuanian national ballet, opera, theater, and art galleries</b>. Shanghai as a major metropolis has its choice of international arts productions, so any potential collaborations would be based on a sense of <b>rapport and camaraderie</b>. <span class="break"></span> In fact, this was why Lina was there: to show that a native Lithuanian could speak high-level Chinese as a <b>nod of cultural respect</b>. Since direct Lithuanian-Chinese professional interpreters are <b>rare</b>, most delegations communicate through the common medium of English. The Chinese side had English translators in place, but as this was <b>a meeting of cultural stakeholders</b>, it seemed essential to allow the Lithuanians as well, especially the cultural minister, to speak directly from their culture: <b>their language</b>. <span class="break"></span> Prior to the meetings, we had already researched the delegation’s communication points along with the <b>latest cultural trends</b> in Shanghai and Lithuania, learned the finer points of <b>diplomatic versus informal language</b>, and dove into the <b>details</b> of each meeting participant’s background to be ready to address each one with the proper respect and title. </p>

In 2016, China has become the largest market of Lithuanian cultural products, especially theater. <span class="break"></span> Cultural collaborations between countries take <b>years in the making</b>, but they all start with the <b>mutual respect and friendship</b> laid in place here. Even the formal meetings had a friendly tone, as Lina explained <b>beyond the meanings</b> of official statements to relate to each country’s culture. The Lithuanian Minister of Culture himself commented about her work, “<b>It is a luxury to have an interpreter who understands context.</b>” </p>

We also focused on titles with <b>immediate positive utility</b>, such as books that improved children’s hand mobility. <span class="break"></span> At the exhibition itself, we had to <b>keep alert for proper matches</b>—offiicial publishing house acquirers who would buy the books’ copyrights for China and <b>NOT undercover creative directors</b> who would copy the Lithuanian books’ innovative educational methods.

                                        <p class="content"> So you’ve got a <b>trusted supplier</b> with a good agreement. The initial production samples look good. But how can you ensure they <b>stay good</b>? Quality fade—what happens when manufacturers go for wider margins by <b>reducing product quality</b>—happens gradually and often without notice. <span class="break"></span> An American company that designed and patented alumninum building support systems supplied their parts from China. Since these support systems were used to construct high-rise buildings, they had sophisticated measurements for each part of the system; <b>not having the right engineering specifications meant compromising building stability</b>. But the Chinese supplier reduced the specifications anyway, until <b>more than 10%</b> of the aluminum weight was missing. <span class="break"></span>
                                            <b>There is little that foreign companies can do even if they catch the supplier.</b> If they recall a product, it is done in their country—after having paid full prices before the product left China. Since supplier relationships are so difficult to find and foster in the first place, it is difficult to switch, and other suppliers may do the same. <b>Supplier information is often kept as trade secrets</b>, so it’s also hard to know by reputation. <span class="break"></span> And when quality goes bad, it can <b>tarnish not only your local but international reputation</b>, as happened with McDonald’s and Yum Brand’s KFC, after a TV program revealed their Chinese supplier, Shanghai Husi Food Co., <b>mixing in expired meat</b>. </p>

Consider luxury ice cream brand Häagen-Dazs, well-known for dominating a Chinese market at a time when the country didn’t even eat much dairy. Since China was so <b>inexperienced with dairy</b>, it didn’t trust local manufacturers and imported all its ice cream from abroad—but then it went <b>a step further</b>. <span class="break"></span> Häagen-Dazs products do best at a <b>constant temperature of -26 degrees Celsius</b>, a lower temperature than most ice creams, and market research found that Chinese freezers wouldn’t be cold or constant enough. So the company invested in its own <b>specially-refrigerated trucks</b> to do all the distribution. Later on, not counting its own stores, it installed <b>5,000 specialty freezers</b> at supermarkets that sold its products. <span class="break"></span> For a brand that promised <b>quality</b>, this was the <b>ultimate guarantee</b>. </p>

Instead of using <b>local expertise</b>, Groupon hired almost all-foreigner business school grads as top management (only two people on its senior management team were Chinese, and one was from Hong Kong). The company expected it could use the <b>same strategy it did in Germany</b> to poach salespeople from competitor companies via high salaries, but Chinese group-buying sites made an alliance such that if their employee left to work for Groupon, they would no longer be able to work in the future in the Chinese alliance. <span class="break"></span> It had looked rosy at the beginning: Groupon was in league with two of <b>China’s biggest tech companies</b>, especially a <b>40% stake from Tencent</b> (parent of the now-ubiquitous WeChat) and a smaller stake including <b>Alibaba</b>. But a <b>non-compete clause</b> was not included in their agreement, and both tech companies had investments in other Chinese group buying companies that ended up doing much better. <span class="break"></span>
                                            <b>Groupon needed Tencent to operate in China much more than Tencent needed Groupon for a group buying web-site</b>, of which many already existed in China. Groupon was even surprised when Lashou, China’s largest group-buying site, refused its huge offer to buy them. <b>Simply having cash and latching on to large Chinese companies with conflicting interests</b> is not a good localization strategy. This led to <b>$46 million in net losses</b> with only $2.1 million revenues within its first three quarters, and it has never recovered. </p>

And it worked with WeChat because it offered a <b>ready-made, exclusive relationship</b>. Yet it took LinkedIn four years of market research in preparation for entering the country. </p>

She made sure to mention that the <b>foreigners were naive</b>, a position that many Chinese already thought, so they were highly pleased with the proposal. <span class="break"></span> Of course, China could not create quality grass seed with no experience; this was what the businesswoman considered “<b>deception without deceit</b>.” For alongside American grass seed experts, she visited China frequently and taught the Chinese how to produce quality grass seed as well as its final flourishing, <b>the lawn</b>. <span class="break"></span> The Chinese realized after a few years that the costs of producing grass seed of a certain quality were too great, but the side effect was that they had <b>learned how to value grass</b>, and specifically, American grass. They began to buy seed directly from the US company and used it to great effect in the <b>1990 Asian games</b>. After the Asian Olympics, <b>grass seed became more popular than ever, selling at over five times the price sold in the U.S.</b> Nowadays in China, even in space-tight cities, lawns in public arenas, private homes, and even the estates of prominent officials likely come from Oregon. </p>

                                        <p class="content"> As a European company, they operated at home with access to a <b>broad range of data</b>—corporate KPIs, K performance indices, best-selling supermarket SKUs—to calculate investments and ROI and make other strategic decisions. But this approach doesn’t work for foreign companies in China, where <b>information is classified and protected by the China chain store association</b>. Nielsen has access to this data, but the costs are exorbitant. Instead of quantitative data, we were able to obtain <b>interviews with experts and KOLs</b> for consumer-based insights on product demand via geographical location and demographics. <span class="break"></span> We realized in the course of this research that supermarkets are not very viable options in the first place; as <b>on-line shopping has become more popular</b>, large supermarkets that one must travel to through requisite traffic jams are becoming defunct. <b>Localized grocery stores</b> would be a better plan, but the company needs to first focus on a particular region in China and expand from that local area. We often tell our clients, “<b>There is no such thing as a singular China</b>.” After all, there are 23 provinces, each with their own cultures and traditions, over 200 languages, and first-to-fourth tier cities. </p>

A typical scam involves a regular Chinese supplier who asks you to make payments to a new bank account. Yet after you pay, your supplier says you still owe it the full amount, often with late fees, because it never received your payment. <span class="break"></span> This scam can happen to the <b>most experienced of companies</b>, even to toy manufacturer <b>Mattel</b>, whose executives wired over USD 3 million to China’s <b>Bank of Wenzhou</b> after a <b>fake e-mail</b> which claimed to hold orders from the company president. <span class="break"></span> Mattel acted quickly, alerting the FBI and Chinese authorities, and eventually got their money back, but <b>most companies have no such luck</b>. Sometimes they might convince the Chinese supplier to cover some of the costs—as it was their computer system that was compromised—but it depends on your <b>supplier relationship</b>. <span class="break"></span> We recommend <b>double-checking</b> everything and putting in <b>safety precautions</b> like confirming payments on land line phone numbers which are much harder to hack, getting the supplier’s bank account information in advance, and having an internal corporate check system before large payments. <span class="break"></span> Your Chinese suppliers will also understand, and perhaps even appreciate, the efforts you make for safety as they too lose out on scams. </p>

                                        <p class="content"> In 2008, it was years of <b>sector specialization and research</b> that allowed a local Chinese detergent brand called <b>Blue Moon</b> to succeed in breaking into a Chinese market dominated by <b>Unilever</b>, <b>Procter & Gamble</b>, and other multinational companies. The smaller company succeeded because it noticed something about the laundry detergent sector that the <b>big companies missed</b>. <span class="break"></span> While the multinationals focused on new products for washing machines, Blue Moon realized a significant portion of the Chinese population was <b>more traditional and still hand-washed their clothes</b>. Laundry powder was available for hand-washing clothes, but Blue Moon introduced a <b>liquid hand-washing detergent</b> that provided a better experience (no clumping!). Even after the other companies caught up, Blue Moon had snagged a steady <b>30%</b> of the liquid detergent market. <span class="break"></span> That’s what happens when you combine <b>cultural sensitivity with careful observation</b> of industry trends. Of course, it helped that they were backed by one of Asia’s top hedge funds, <b>Hillhouse Capital</b>, which makes investments and gives advice to Chinese start-ups. <span class="break"></span> But even after their initial success, the company <b>didn’t stop their momentum</b>. They continued to launch the detergent that worked, focusing on their best-selling SKU instead of branching into various new detergents. <span class="break"></span> Instead, they spent money on research and marketing. In 2011, a full three years after they sucessfully broke into the market, <b>they spent USD 500 million alone for advertising</b>. Their executives also met with a team from JD.com, one of China’s largest on-line marketplaces, to find ways to make the <b>delivery process more efficient</b>; they redesigned their detergent carton to fit with JD’s online delivery boxes. </p>

                                        <p class="content"> In 2012, they cut advertising but then <b>hired salespeople to directly interact with customers</b> in supermarkets, asking them to sample-smell patches of the detergent as if it were a perfume in a department store. They were constantly trying <b>new strategies</b> to present themselves not as the most affordable in their industry but instead “<b>different and desirable</b>.” </p> <img src="home-images/our_work/case/eye.png" class="img-fluid eye_up">

And all investors are looking for not just good products but <b>strong opportunities</b>. <span class="break"></span> We found that compared to the U.S. market which preferred 0.8ct to 1ct diamonds, the Chinese market up to now showed preferences for <b>smaller 0.3 to 0.7ct diamonds</b>. With China’s <b>growing per capita GDP</b>, this demonstrated potential for average diamond order values to also increase. Desk research yielded many interesting insights, and we soon had a consumer focus, investment plan, and target revenues. <span class="break"></span> Yet how could the brand itself show off their China knowledge without having any experience in the Chinese market? LITAO arranged a series of <b>mystery shopping visits</b> in Shanghai for the company CEO and a selected female companion, who pretended to be his fiancee. Through our strategically-designed questions, they learned from jewelers firsthand what designs sold best in their stores (for example, Chinese had more desire for colored diamonds; how stores were set up; and how salespeople provided service (with Chinese couples being generally more reticent about their impending engagement). </p>

                                <b>Import and distribution channels in China are complex and change frequently</b>. Import procedures must be handled by licensed importers who sometimes act as distributors as well. However, most food distributors and traders are unlikely to hold import licenses so once again, we depend on <b>insider reputations</b> to find you the best distributor for your needs. This is also the stage for preparing all <b>customs documentation</b>.
                                <span class="break"></span> Distribution in China is quite fragmented, being generally handled on a <b>store-by-store</b> or <b>city-by-city</b> basis, with stores receiving most imports through a series of local distributors. This means that depending on where you want your product to go, you may need <b>multiple different regional distributors</b>. We help you <b>keep track of them</b> all through our own sustainable network of local distribution channels.
