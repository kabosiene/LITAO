                      they could do identical product tests on both
                      sides and compare results. However, the
                      Chinese bureau’s standards allowed for only
                      three testing methods, two of which weren’t
                      even used in the US. They both agreed to do the

                      identical materials, yielding results that finally
                      allowed the company to ship to China. Without
                      the law firm’s friendly relationship with the local
                      inspection bureau, their products would still be
                      languishing across the sea.

                    agreement to import apples to China in August
                    2014.
                    <span class="break"></span>
                    Fresh vegetables and fruits are especially
                    difficult to be approved for import to China;
                    even though they usually have fewer risks of
                    contamination, the Chinese government treated
                    with politically weighty fruit import with the
                    procedural caution usually reserved for animal
                    products. All grower hygiene methods and
                    qualities had to be adjusted and inspected, and
                    each apple had to be traced back to its origins.
                    <span class="break"></span>
                    The trade agreement was finalized almost two
                    years later in June 2016—this after a series of
                    inspections, meetings between the two
                    country’s heads of states, and after the Polish
                    prime minister personally requested that the
                    agreement be expedited. According to the
                    Polish embassy in Beijing though, this was
                    actually the FASTEST negotiation of this kind
                    from EU states to the China market.

                    Regardless of the product, be prepared to wait at
                    least a year for your product to be approved. If
                    you’re not prepared for this, it could cause
                    immense delays in your entry strategy. And
                    remember: just meeting the regulations isn’t
                    enough in China; it can also change them
                    anytime. In this case, even though fruits and
                    vegetables have less stringent quality inspection
                    standards, the Chinese government treated
                    them with the same standards as animal
                    products.
                    <span class="break"></span>
                    Regulations now are much stricter than a few
                    decades ago, when China was just opening up
                    and wanting to attract foreign companies. Now
                    foreign companies are clamoring to enter, and
                    China can pick and choose.

                  China differs from the EU, the US and
                  most other countries in the world for
                  having a “first-to-file” trademark system.
                  <span class="break"></span>
                  Companies like Apple have had to pay millions
                  of dollars in court and settlement fees bcause
                  Chinese companies can lay claim to patents
                  even if they weren’t the first to develop a certain
                  technology—as long as they were first to USE
                  them in a Chinese market product.
                  <span class="break"></span>
                  In July 2012, Apple paid $60 million to a small
                  vendor for ownership of the “iPad” trademark,
                  which the local Chinese company had previously
                  registered. This delayed the introduction of the
                  iPad 2 in China. More recently, another
                  little-known startup won a case against Apple’s
                  iPhone 6 and 6 Plus based on a smartphone
                  design patent.
                  <span class="break"></span>
                  Foreign companies often get entangled in
                  intellectual property battles in China, where the
                  courts proetect local intellectual property
                  rights and the sheer number of companies
                  means names aren’t guaranteed. China filed
                  12.5% more patent applications and 18.2% more
                  trademark applications in 2015 compared to the
                  year before, and this number is only growing.
                  The same goes for domain names; when
                  GroupOn tried to register as groupon.cn or
                  groupon.com.cn, the names had already been
                  registered by a copycat Chinese competitor,
                  complete with the GroupOn company name,
                  logo, and site design. It could do nothing about
                  the copying, and also had to use a much less
                  recognizable domain.

                  system as soon as you can, even before your

                Our client, a U.S. NGO, runs summer programs
                in the U.S. for students from China. An agent in
                China promoted their programs abroad. But
                when the NGO wanted to open an office in
                China, they discovered the agent had already
                registered their HOBY trademark for
                themselves. LITAO served as their go-between.

              <span class="subtitle color-red ">The LITAO approach to a Stolen Trademark</span>
              <p class="content">The first reaction in such a situation may be an
                immediate sense of betrayal: the NGO couldn’t
                even use their own logo as promotion since the
                trademark had already been taken.
                <span class="break"></span>
                It may seem justified to confront the agent in
                question with accusations, but LITAO
                encouraged the organization to stay calm. We
                knew intellectual property rights worked
                differently in China, and our lawyers confirmed
                the same. We advised a communication strategy
                to test the waters, and as it turns out, the agent
                had registered the trademark for the benefit of
                the NGO as well as themselves—so other
                Chinese organizations would not fake their
                programs, another common occurence in China.

                had registered first. But as there was good will on
                both sides, the agent agreed to transfer the IP
                rights to the NGO free of charge. The two went
                on to further cooperation—this would not have
                happened had the communication strategy been

                For a long time, the diapers industry did not
                take off in China—until 2007, when Proctor &

                diaper-wearing to better sleep—and research
                showing that this “golden sleep” meant better
                brain development. For a country where parents
                will do anything to ensure their kids’ success in
                school, sales went up 55%—and as another

                For memorable branding, talk about yourself in a
                way local people can understand. The Chinese
                don’t believe storks bring babies, so don’t
                advertise your products as such. Meanwhile, the
                Chinese ARE obsessed with their children’s
                education and test scores, so use that as a
                leverage point. Make the connection between
                your product and the culture you’re trying to sell

                how you can help.

              This is the by-now famous story of Starbucks: a
              coffee

              to

              a
              thousand-year+
              tea
              culture.
              Starbucks
              researchers realized they could sell not the
              coffee as a product itself, but an experience
              around it.
              <span class="break"></span>
              They invested in prime, central business
              locations; leather armchairs, plush sofas, and
              other posh decor in a dimly lit environment; and
              outdoor seating with parasols for a European
              ambience. Businessmen could hold meetings in
              the private but bustling atmosphere; the
              status-conscious could sit and sip with their
              girlfriends in front of the large glass windows,
              taking selfies and hoping to be seen.
              <span class="break"></span>
              Coffee as a status symbol of the West was
              perfect for a country with a growing
              upper-middle class that loves conspicuous
              consumption. Starbucks gave them more than a
              drink; it gave them a certain enviable experience
              and lifestyle. And China has now become its
              largest market outside of the U.S.

            Everyone knows brand names and logos
            are important, but with Chinese social
            media famous for puns they can make
            out of various homonyms, the Chinese
            versions can truly make or break you.
            <span class="break"></span>
            Creating a great brand name is not only a
            powerful marketing tool; if you don’t create it,
            you might not like what the Chinese consumers
            call it in its place. Two famous trademarks that
            did not make Chinese versions of their brand
            before entering the market met this fate.
            Chinese found it difficult to pronounce the
            phonetics of their foreign names in Chinese, so
            they called them by their logos: Quaker
            Oatmeal thus became “Lao Ren Pai,” which
            translates to “Old Man Brand,” and Ralph
            Lauren became “Three-Legged Horse.” Not
            exactly sexy branding.
            <span class="break"></span>
            Meanwhile, Coca-cola is an early example of
            good branding at work; it was first sold in China
            in 1927, but local shopkeepers couldn’t figure
            out what to call it in China. They tried to find
            Chinese characters that sounded close to the
            name, coming up with a pool of 200 or so
            characters. But the names the shopkeepers
            came up with had strange definitions: though
            they were phonetically similar, the meanings
            varied from “female horse fastened with wax” to
            “bite the wax tadpole.”
            <span class="break"></span>
            It was only a year later that Coca-Cola
            employees finally registered its current name: a
            combination of characters that means “to
            permit mouth to be able to rejoice”—a huge step
            up from horses and tadpoles the copying, and
            also had to use a much less recognizable domain.

            Don’t wait for others to define you; since they
            don’t care about your reputation, their haphazard
            and sometimes disrespectful ideas are almost
            always going to be worse than ones you carefully
            craft with the help of local language experts.
            Choose a localized brand name with its
            associated meanings as carefully as choosing a
            name for a child, or as carefully you did the first

          “Democracy” is the most celebrated play of
          Mindaugas
          Nastaravicius—a
          Lithuanian
          playwright who won a “Golden Cross of the
          Stage,” the highest award for theater in
          Lithuania.
          <span class="break"></span>
          LITAO was approached to translate this play and
          adapt it for China for the 2016 Bookworm
          International Literary Festival.
        </p>
        <h5 class="content_title_approach">The LITAO Approach:</h5>
        <p class="content">
          True literary translation means cultural
          integration. Beyond language, we had to make
          sure ALL the elements of the play, from names
          and characters to jokes and cultural references,
          worked in China.
          <span class="break"></span>
          Even the title of the play—Democracy—could
          attract unwanted political attention in a country
          like China. We changed it to an innocuous title
          in Chinese, 停电大楼, similar to “The Power is
          Out”—something intriguing without alerting the
          eyes of Chinese censors.
          <span class="break"></span>
          The playwright had intended to translate simply
          the original concept and ideas—knowing that
          while his topics were universal, his references
          were not—and we worked with him closely to get
          his vision right but also relevant for China.
          <span class="break"></span>
          His play featured Lithuanians in various social
          strata with personalities and characteristics
          familiar to Lithuanians; we adjusted that to
          prototypical characters from mainland China. A
          Russian Lithuanian therefore became a
          character from Northeast China, both known
          for their thick accents and alcoholic tolerance.
          All Catholic references were changed to
          Buddhist ones to better reflect local Chinese
          roots.
          <span class="break"></span>
          We collaborated on all of this to the author’s
          satisfaction within only one(!) month.

          The Chinese reading of the play was
          well-received by audience members at the 2016
          Bookworm Festival in Chengdu, China; the
          festival organizers were also extremely
          impressed at our culturally-astute adaptation.
          Subsequently, the playwright was approached by
          mainland China theaters offering to stage the
          play, as well as opportunities to publish it in
          Chinese.

        Viciunai Group, the biggest surimi manufacturer
        in Europe and among the top five in the world
        (producing 160,000 tons of food products each
        year), wanted to globalize even further. But
        China itself is the world’s largest (and cheap!)

        After extensive market research and mystery
        visits to all key foreign grocery retailers in
        Shanghai to determine best-performing SKUs,
        our most prominent strategy was to go the route
        of premiumization. After all, the company could
        not hope to compete with Chinese brands on
        pricing. And data on China predicted increased
        consumer awareness of food quality as well as a
        decline in meat consumption—an opportunity
        for seafood. Yet we found that this was only if
        seafood was presented as high-quality protein
        with a story behind it; premium brands have
        company narratives while mass-market ones
        don’t.
        <span class="break"></span>
        To create our company story, we learned the
        origins of the fish in Lithuania and researched
        specifications from top certifying bodies such as
        the Marine Stewardship Council to find what
        most concerned consumers about quality. We
        also researched factors from packaging
        convenience to location for our target market,
        modern urban premium consumers.

        Viciunai Group in Europe sold their surimi

          Interpretation is not to be taken lightly.
          In fact, Fortune Magazine has named
          interpreter Zhang Lu as one of the
          “world’s most powerful women.”
          <span class="break"></span>
          She serves as the voice of China’s top leaders,
          including Premier Li Keqiang. In diplomatic
          situations, the interpreter’s voice stands as the
          voice of authority, and any deviation from both
          meaning and tone is an indictment on the nation
          itself.
          <span class="break"></span>
          The U.S. Department of State had to learn this
          the hard way. When then-U.S. Secretary of
          State Hillary Clinton met Russian Foreign
          Minister Sergei Lavrov in 2009, she presented
          him a joke gift of a mock “reset” button—in
          symbolic honor of a relationship reset between
          the U.S. and Russia from tensions in the past.
          But the word the State Department chose for
          “reset” was the Russian “peregruzka,” which
          wrongly meant “overload”—the opposite of the
          meaning they were trying to convey (overload of
          tensions is never good), as Lavrov was quick to
          point out.
          <span class="break"></span>
          The correct word for “reset” in Russian required
          an extra syllable: “perezagruzka.” If only the
          resources of the State Department had thought
          to first check the translation with a Russian
          expert!

          Interpretation is a series of details and nuances
          that add up to a larger meaning such that you can
          barely notice the subtleties when it’s right, but
          you’ll sure notice when it’s missing. It pays to get
          the details right, especially for something as
          fickle as language. Hire a good interpreter, one
          who will be on your side and get across not just
          your literal meaning, but your intention.

                    In the early 1990’s, prospects were good
                    for the growth of tourism and
                    investment in Yunnan, a province with
                    unique ethnicities and bountiful nature
                    in Southwest China. The Roaring Dragon
                    at that time was a well-known
                    40-year-old four-star hotel, one of the
                    first in the region, owned by the
                    provincial government and managed by
                    local Chinese.
                    <span class="break"></span>
                    But as a state-owned enterprise, their close to
                    700 staff lacked motivation since steady salaries
                    would be paid for by the government in any case,
                    and even though the hotel was still profitable,
                    the government thought it wasn’t meeting its
                    potential.
                    <span class="break"></span>
                    And so the government contracted foreign
                    management companies to take over:
                    One takeover in 1993 lost them nine million
                    RMB in a year.
                    The second one in 1999, by an international
                    hotel brand named Nothill, lost more than ten
                    million RMB in less than four months, with hotel
                    capacity nearing empty towards the end.
                    <span class="break"></span>
                    In between these two periods, when Chinese
                    management retook the system, the hotel did
                    well again. It was clear that the foreign
                    management did have better standards of
                    services and more high-class hotel experience.
                    But their international reputation did nothing to
                    attract visitors; in fact, it sometimes seemed
                    arrogant.
                    <span class="break"></span>
                    Both times, foreign-educated managers
                    neglected the Chinese element of guanxi, or
                    connections. These connections always came
                    with a price: they were relationships of “you help
                    me, I help you.” Giving discounts to friends in
                    tour agencies meant they would bring their
                    groups to you. Hosting banquets in honor of
                    government officials meant you could pass
                    through bureaucratic processes much more
                    smoothly. Hiring your friends or relatives meant
                    they owed you something. The regular up-dating
                    of these guanxi—meals, tea, gifts, even leisurely
                    chats over nothing—were essential for
                    relationship maintenance of mutual benefit..

                    Guanxi is effective, but it is not always efficient.
                    Foreign managers at the Roaring Dragon saw it
                    simply as favoritism or nepotism; they banned
                    discounts, hiring based on connections, and
                    other incentives based on guanxi. Once, a
                    foreign F&B manager outright refused a tour
                    group a banquet because he deemed it too
                    cheap. The tour agency, which another Chinese
                    manager had carefully cultivated guanxi with and
                    which often booked large groups into the hotel,
                    never booked tour groups in the hotel again. The
                    guanxi was ruined, and the agent left to a
                    competitor. Government officials were no longer
                    given star treatment and discounts, so they left,
                    too.
                    <span class="break"></span>
                    Employees also complained that “the foreign
                    management did not know the Chinese way”:
                    they were no longer allowed to take long breaks,
                    to invite their friends to the hotel for no reason,
                    even to eat with each other as per new schedules.
                    Long-time employees who were made redundant
                    complained of not being treated with respect,
                    since they were being laid off and paid on a single
                    day without prior notice. Employee morale had
                    depressed so much that even if they were not
                    made redundant under new policies, many
                    high-level employees left of their own accord,
                    oftentimes with years of guanxi.
                    <span class="break"></span>
                    Guanxi, because it is so personal, is something
                    that is not transferable. In their quest to make
                    everything more efficient, foreign managers had
                    actually lost the very business and people they
                    sought to attract.

                    Interpretation is a series of details and nuances
                    that add up to a larger meaning such that you can
                    barely notice the subtleties when it’s right, but
                    you’ll sure notice when it’s missing. It pays to get
                    the details right, especially for something as
                    fickle as language. Hire a good interpreter, one
                    who will be on your side and get across not just
                    your literal meaning, but your intention.

                  The Lithuanian Minister of Culture visited
                  Shanghai
                  to
                  discuss
                  cooperation
                  with
                  representatives of five major Chinese cultural
                  stakeholders, including Shanghai vice-mayor

                  Lina served as a diplomatic interpreter between
                  the two cultural delegations in a series of
                  meetings, both formal and informal, in 2016.
                </p>
                <h5 class="content_title_approach">The LITAO Approach:</h5>
                <p class="content">
                  The Lithuanian cultural delegation included not
                  just the Minister of Culture, but also the heads
                  of Lithuanian national ballet, opera, theater, and
                  art galleries. Shanghai as a major metropolis has
                  its choice of international arts productions, so
                  any potential collaborations would be based on a
                  sense of rapport and camaraderie.
                  <span class="break"></span>
                  In fact, this was why Lina was there: to show that
                  a native Lithuanian could speak high-level
                  Chinese as a nod of cultural respect. Since
                  direct Lithuanian-Chinese professional interpreters
                  are rare, most delegations communicate
                  through the common medium of English. The
                  Chinese side had English translators in place,
                  but as this was a meeting of cultural
                  stakeholders, it seemed essential to allow the
                  Lithuanians as well, especially the cultural
                  minister, to speak directly from their culture:
                  their language.
                  <span class="break"></span>
                  Prior to the meetings, we had already
                  researched the delegation’s communication
                  points along with the latest cultural trends in
                  Shanghai and Lithuania, learned the finer points
                  of diplomatic versus informal language, and
                  dove into the details of each meeting
                  participant’s background to be ready to address
                  each one with the proper respect and title.

                  By allowing the Lithuanian minister and Chinese
                  vice-mayor to both speak their native tongues,
                  by having a Lithuanian to translate into fluent
                  high-level Chinese and vice versa—LITAO
                  enabled both sides to pay the ultimate cultural
                  respect. In 2016, China has become the largest
                  market of Lithuanian cultural products,
                  especially theater.

                  Cultural collaborations between countries take
                  years in the making, but they all start with the
                  mutual respect and friendship laid in place here.
                  Even the formal meetings had a friendly tone, as
                  Lina explained beyond the meanings of official
                  statements to relate to each country’s culture.
                  The Lithuanian Minister of Culture himself
                  commented, “it is a luxury to have an interpreter
                  who understands context.”

                Flintas, a Lithuanian children’s books publisher,
                was entering the China International Children’s
                Book Fair in Shanghai for the first time. Though
                a thriving publisher in its home country, it didn’t
                know any of the requirements for China’s strict
                censorship laws and differentiations between
                publishers. LITAO was hired prior to and during
                the exhibition to prepare Flintas’ offerings and
                seek potential matches.

                We first sorted through the publisher’s hundreds
                of titles to determine what would work best,
                settling on a total of twelve books marketed to
                children up to five years old. The age limit itself
                was a strategic move: the more illustrations and
                fewer words, the less there would be to censor.
                We also focused on titles with immediate
                positive utility, such as books that improved
                children’s hand mobility.
                <span class="break"></span>
                At the exhibition itself, we had to keep alert for
                proper matches—offiicial publishing house
                acquirers who would buy the books’ copyrights
                for China and NOT undercover creative
                directors who would copy the Lithuanian books’
                innovative educational methods. As such, we
                had to be very selective with the information we
                gave away, filtering through layers of
                conversation to discover the true roles of the
                various inquirers.

              Taking advantage of foreign companies who

              the
              real

              Chinese
              manufacturers and deliverers often try to dupe
              foreigners by stating “such and such is Chinese
              law”: things like requiring the foreign company
              to transfer IP ownership or enter into exclusive
              distribution arrangeemtns with Chinese
              companies.
              <span class="break"></span>
              There are no such laws for IP transfer or
              exclusivity requirements! In fact, it is extremely
              important not to enter into exclusivity
              arrangements with a distributor/marketer/seller
              because even if they are very good in one region
              of China, they may not be in another.
              <span class="break"></span>
              In addition, if they have an exclusivity
              agreement with you, it is possible they have
              another agreement with a competitor company.
              They may simply choose not to sell your product
              so the other one doesn’t suffer from the
              competition, and because you signed X years of
              exclusivity, there is nothing you can do.
              <span class="break"></span>
              Exclusive distribution is part of what led
              Hershey’s down the hole in China: its sales in
              2015 were USD 90 million less than the
              projected USD 200 million, mostly because it
              had acquired a local candy maker company
              called Shanghai Golden Monkey to expand its
              local distributor network. But the distributor
              and customer network was not as broad or as
              stable as they had believed—and since they had
              spent USD 584 million acquiring the company,
              they were stuck with them.

            So you’ve got a trusted supplier with a good
            agreement. The initial production samples look
            good. But how can you insure they stay good?
            Quality fade—what happens when manufacturers
            go for wider margins by reducing product
            quality—happens gradually and often without
            notice.

            An American company that designed and
            patented alumninum building support systems
            supplied their parts from China. Since these
            support systems were used to construct
            high-rise buildings, they had sophisticated
            measurements for each part of the system; not
            having the right engineering specifications
            meant compromising building stability. But the
            Chinese supplier reduced the specifications
            anyway, until more than 10% of the aluminum
            weight was missing.
            <span class="break"></span>
            There is little that foreign companies can do
            even if they catch the supplier. If they recall a
            product, it is done in their country—after having
            paid full prices before the product left China.
            Since supplier relationships are so difficult to
            find and foster in the first place, it is difficult to
            switch, and other suppliers may do the same.
            Supplier information is often kept as trade
            secrets, so it’s also hard to know by reputation.
            <span class="break"></span>
            And when quality goes bad, it can tarnish not
            only your local but international reputation, as
            happened with McDonald’s and Yum Brand’s
            KFC, after a TV program revealed their Chinese
            supplier, Shanghai Husi Food Co., mixing in
            expired meat.

            Even quality changes that may not seem like a big
            deal can accumulate over time. When quality
            issues are at hand, the hidden manufacturers
            don’t bear the burdens. The negative
            repercussions fall on the company who trusted
            those suppliers, so do your QC constantly and
            vigilantly.

          And even if your manufacturers are good,
          consider your distributors carefully, especially if
          you have a specialty product. Consider luxury
          ice cream brand Haagen-Dasz, well-known for
          dominating a Chinese market at a time when the
          country didn’t even eat much dairy. Since China
          was so inexperienced with dairy, it didn’t trust
          local manufacturers and imported all its ice
          cream from abroad—but then it went a step
          further.
          <span class="break"></span>
          Haagen-Dasz products do best at a constant
          temperature of -26 degrees Celsius, a lower
          temperature than most ice creams, and market
          research found that Chinese freezers wouldn’t
          be cold or constant enough. So the company
          invested in its own specially-refrigerated trucks
          to do all the distribution. Later on, not counting
          its own stores, it installed 5,000 specialty
          freezers at supermarkets that sold its products.
          <span class="break"></span>
          For a brand that promised quality, this was the
          ultimate guarantee.

          In the midst of considerations about suppliers
          and consumers, don’t forget about the
          middleman: the distributor. If you have a product
          that needs to be taken care of in some way to be
          in its ultimate best state, your distributor will
          make the difference. Haagen-Dasz bought
          specialty freezers and delivery trucks, but it’s not
          necessary to do everything yourself; we can help
          find you the best distributors for your particular
          needs.

        An individual businessman sought to launch a
        private-label insulated coffee thermos to be sold
        on Amazon, with all production taking place in
        China. He had the brand, but needed quality
        manufacturing at European standards, not
        something China is known for.
      </p>
      <h5 class="content_title_approach">The LITAO Approach:</h5>
      <p class="content">
        Rigorous and systematic quality control was the
        biggest focus. We provided three best options of
        known direct suppliers; working with the
        manufacturers
        themselves—not
        resellers—allowed us to control production
        outcomes.
        <span class="break"></span>
        In Europe, manufacturers are expected to
        comply with 100% of company requests, but in
        China, standards are often relaxed and products
        turn out in slightly different colors or even sizes;
        factories sometimes even start using different
        materials without informing the client. This
        might be okay for Chinese wholesalers, but not
        for us.
        <span class="break"></span>
        Even after ordering samples and choosing a
        manufacturer, we hired a QC supervisor from
        Shanghai to go personally to the factories each
        week. Check-in points were implemented in all
        stages
        of
        production:
        samples
        during
        manufacturing, full QC pre-shipment, and
        supervision while loading—all while keeping to
        production schedule.

      <h6>The Outcomes</h6>
      <p class="content">
        For this product, we filtered up to 2% of goods
        produced with quality issues—including a batch
        with a misprinted logo—and pressured the
        factory into producing proper ones in only a few
        hours to make a shipment dead-line. Only
        careful vetting would ensure such fast and
        accurate turnaround. The client continues to
        order new batches, with sales profitable from the
        3rd quarter and increasing. His line of production
        now includes not just a coffee thermos in various
        colors but also a glass bottle and a flask, all
        thoroughly QC-ed; other products are in

          GroupOn dominates much of the
          international market, but not China,
          despite entering with millions in
          investments and prominent Chinese
          partners.
          <span class="break"></span>
          This was mostly a failure in long-term strategic
          thinking from the beginning: a strategy that
          sought to fit China to GroupOn’s international
          model instead of the other way around. Instead
          of using local expertise, GroupOn hired almost
          all-foreigner business school grads as top
          management (only two people on its senior
          management team were Chinese, and one was
          from Hong Kong). The company expected it
          could use the same strategy it did in Germany to
          poach salespeople from competitor companies
          via high salaries, but Chinese group-buying sites
          made an alliance such that if their employee left
          to work for GroupOn, they would no longer be
          able to work in the future in the Chinese
          alliance.
          <span class="break"></span>
          It had looked rosy at the beginning: GroupOn
          was in league with two of China’s biggest tech
          companies, especially a 40% stake from Tencent
          (parent of the now-ubiquitous WeChat) and a
          smaller stake including Alibaba. But a
          non-compete clause was not included in their
          agreement, and both tech companies had
          investments in other Chinese group buying
          companies that ended up doing much better.
          <span class="break"></span>
          GroupOn needed Tencent to operate in China
          much more than Tencent needed GroupOn for a
          group buying web-site, of which many already
          existed in China. GroupOn was even surprised
          when Lashou, China’s largest group-buying site,
          refused its huge offer to buy them. Simply
          having cash and latching on to large Chinese
          companies with conflicting interests is not a
          good localization strategy. This led to $46
          million in net losses with only $2.1 million
          revenues within its first three quarters, and it
          has never recovered.

          Sometimes it does help to link with big Chinese

          million Chinese users. It knew that China was an
          increasingly mobile country that relies less on

          Localize YOURSELF. Don’t trust even Chinese
          partners to do your work for you. Don’t assume
          that you can copy & paste a technique from
          another company, even multiple other countries,
          where it’s worked. Having cash doesn’t mean
          your competitors will take your offer to buy
          them, espeically in copycat China; you have to
          differentiate yourself from the beginning.

        After a massive earthquake hit western China in
        2008, Nestlé donated 10 million yuan—no
        strings—to disaster relief. When the melamine
        tainted milk scandal hit China, Nestle had
        already planted seeds twenty years earlier for

        If you’re really going for the long haul,
        consider this deep-rooted strategy
        businesswoman Chin-Ning Chu used, as
        discussed in her best-seller book on
        business in China, “Thick Face, Black
        Heart”:
        <span class="break"></span>
        This was back in the early 1980’s, and her client
        was a US grass seed manufacturer from the
        state of Oregon—a top grass-seed-producing
        region in the world, fulfilling 50% of the world’s
        demands—that was determined to sell to China.
        But to the Chinese, grass was a weed and
        needed to be pulled out; to call someone “grass”
        was an insult, and for years, the Chinese
        refused—until Chu took the case.
        <span class="break"></span>
        At the time, foreign currency was restricted and
        difficult to exchange from the Chinese yuan, so
        Chu proposed to Chinese officials that an
        American company wanted to produce seeds in
        China and buy them back in US currency at the
        same price they paid American farmers. She
        made sure to mention that the foreigners were
        naive, a position that many Chinese already
        thought, so they were highly pleased with the
        proposal.
        <span class="break"></span>
        Of course, China could not create quality grass
        seed with no experience; this was what the
        businesswoman considered “deception without
        deceit.” For alongside American grass seed
        experts, she visited China frequently and taught
        the Chinese how to produce quality grass seed
        as well as its final flourishing, the lawn.
        <span class="break"></span>
        The Chinese realized after a few years that the
        costs of producing grass seed of a certain
        quality were too great, but the side effect was
        that they had learned how to value grass, and
        specifically, American grass. They began to buy
        seed directly from the US company and used it
        to great effect in the 1990 Asian games. After
        the Asian Olympics, grass seed became more
        popular than ever, selling at over five times the
        price sold in the U.S. Nowadays in China, even in
        space-tight cities, lawns in public arenas,
        private homes, and even the estates of
        prominent officials likely come from Oregon.

        A European FMCG distributor is among the
        largest in its country. It has over a decade of
        experience sourcing from China and selling in
        the West. But now it wants to reverse the flow
        and build a retail supermarket chain in mainland
        China itself. They approached LITAO for a
        localized China market entry strategy but did
        not know where in China they wanted to start.
      </p>
      <h5 class="content_title_approach">The LITAO Approach:</h5>
      <p class="content">
        As a European company, they operated at home
        with access to a broad range of data—corporate
        KPIs, K performance indices, best-selling
        supermarket SKUs—to calculate investments
        and ROI and make other strategic decisions. But
        this approach doesn’t work for foreign
        companies in China, where information is
        classified and protected by the China chain
        store association. Nielsen has access to this
        data, but the costs are exorbitant. Instead of
        quantitative data, we were able to obtain
        interviews with experts and KOLs for
        consumer-based insights on product demand via
        geographical location and demographics.
        <span class="break"></span>
        We realized in the course of this research that
        supermarkets are not very viable options in the
        first place; as on-line shopping has become
        more popular, large supermarkets that one must
        travel to through requisite traffic jams are
        becoming defunct. Localized grocery stores
        would be a better plan, but the company needs
        to first focus on a particular region in China and
        expand from that local area. We often tell our
        clients, “There is no such thing as a singular
        China.” After all, there are 23 provinces, each
        with their own cultures and traditions, over 200
        languages, and first-to-fourth tier cities.

      <p class="content">
        We helped the client adjust their China mainland
        market entry strategy to include more O2O
        instead of slowly decaying brick-and-mortar
        stores. They are realizing there truly is not one
        China, since people in this country have more
        regionally-based differences in consumer
        shopping habits than people in any other country
        in the world. The company is now focusing on
        selecting a narrower target audience to truly
        understand a local customer and sell them not
        only products, but a lifestyle—the only viable way
        to win in the age of Internet shopping.

        A premium European water brand with their own
        purification technology was looking to sell to
        China, but didn’t know where to start as the
        Chinese market is saturated with water suppliers
        and skeptical distributors, given the country’s
        history of water quality scandals. We helped the
        company find their unique pitch for potential
        B2B China partners while protecting their
        intellectual property and international brand
        equity.
      </p>
      <h5 class="content_title_approach">The LITAO Approach:</h5>
      <p class="content">
        We knew there was an opportunity in China, as
        data trends from Zenith International and
        Euromonitor showed bottled water consumption
        would likely double in the next five years. Our
        client wanted to enter the market right away,
        yet we warned them from doing so while their
        technology and trademark were not yet
        protected.
        <span class="break"></span>
        We focused instead on finding their brand
        positioning in China, first determining and
        analyzing best-selling Chinese and foreign
        water brands, especially independent or
        boutique brands similar to our client. We
        focused on five most relevant brands, two local
        and three foreign, to study in detail, and offered
        insights on how to differentiate from them and
        other competitors with value-added points
        (other than being from Europe!) and build a
        good brand and visual identity.
        <span class="break"></span>
        By building a strong brand presence prior to
        coming to China, they would be much more
        protected from brand imitators.

        We prevented the client from coming to China
        too early—a time when their water purification
        methods weren’t patented and their trademark
        wasn’t protected in either China or abroad. While
        the branding and patent process is ongoing, the
        company has entered negotiations with LITAO to
        serve as their official China agent once the
        protection pulls through.

          With
          push
          from
          the
          Chinese
          government, the RMB is becoming
          increasingly internationalized. But it will
          still take a number of years before it
          shares equal status with the dollar, the
          euro, the pound, and the yen.
          <span class="break"></span>
          Most EU and US banks won’t accept RMB, so
          the money has to be transferred to Hong Kong
          and converted. Getting money out of and to
          China also takes some maneuvering because
          Chinese, both individuals and companies,
          popularly use mobile payments on WeChat and
          Alipay—like Paypal for the Western world, but
          even larger in scope.
          <span class="break"></span>
          The Chinese government is also making it more
          difficult to move money out of China via large
          corporate transactions, as many of China’s
          uber-rich use corporate buys as a cover to move
          cash into overseas banks and real estate
          (Chinese individuals are only allowed to send up
          to USD 50,000 overseas per year). Transfers
          are subject to scrutiny by the Chinese
          government, which has been tightening since
          the beginning of 2016, and can cause real time
          lags in foreign companies getting the necessary
          funds. If you don’t know who to contact or how
          to prove your legitimacy, you may not be in
          trouble but you’ll certainly be delayed.

          With the RMB yet to be completely
          internationalized and many Chinese using local
          payment schemes, it’s important to know how to
          get legally paid with the least amount of hassle
          and fees in your home country. In recent years,
          as more of China’s wealth boom moves overseas,
          the Chinese government is also making it more
          difficult for money to move out of China, with
          even legitimate transfers subject to scrutiny.

        Another thing to watch out for is financial fraud,
        something even the Chinese government has
        trouble controlling. A typical scam involves a
        regular Chinese supplier who asks you to make
        payments to a new bank account. Yet after you
        pay, your supplier says you still owe it the full
        amount, often with late fees, because it never
        received your payment.
        <span class="break"></span>
        This scam can happen to the most experienced
        of companies, even to toy manufacturer Mattel,
        whose executives wired over USD 3 million to
        China’s Bank of Wenzhou after a fake e-mail
        which claimed to hold orders from the company
        president.
        <span class="break"></span>
        Mattel acted quickly, alerting the FBI and
        Chinese authorities, and eventually got their
        money back, but most companies have no such
        luck. Sometimes they might convince the
        Chinese supplier to cover some of the costs—as
        it was their computer system that was
        compromised—but it depends on your supplier
        relationship.
        <span class="break"></span>
        We recommend double-checking everything
        and putting in safety precautions like confirming
        payments on land line phone numbers which are
        much harder to hack, getting the supplier’s bank
        account information in advance, and having an
        internal corporate check system before large
        payments.
        <span class="break"></span>
        Your Chinese suppliers will also understand, and
        perhaps even appreciate, the efforts you make
        for safety as they too lose out on scams.

        Even huge experienced companies can fall to the

        company policy to double-check each other and
        with
        whoever
        you’re
        paying,

        A frozen meat trading company in Europe
        wished to enter the China market with zero prior
        presence in China. LITAO’s role was to
        essentially create this presence—to create an
        image of trust to drive sales.
      </p>
      <h5 class="content_title_approach">The LITAO Approach:</h5>
      <p class="content">
        The company’s biggest setback was their lack of
        reputation in China. As traders, their
        competitors include other companies who trade
        the same products as well as producers who sell
        them in China directly. And who would buy from
        an unknown company when they could get the
        same products with a familiar one?
        <span class="break"></span>
        LITAO purchased data from Chinese customs
        on the biggest importers of best-performing
        meat products in China and contacted their
        sales and managers one by one to research best
        practices. Prior to representing the company at
        the SIAL Shanghai food exhibition, we
        developed various sales leads, registered and
        implemented a corporate WeChat Official
        Account for branding, set up a virtual office and
        data management system, and hired and trained
        loyal sales staff.
        <span class="break"></span>
        We knew our target clients were up-and-coming
        and relatively inexperienced Chinese sellers and
        importers, not huge established companies with
        their own networks, so we focused on selling to
        smaller companies. This meant targeting clients
        who did not speak English, who wanted easier
        cross-border payment solutions including
        WeChat and Alipay, who needed more
        explanations; we even provided them with
        B2B2C advice so they could market products
        better to their own consumers.

        The other risk with emerging companies, as
        always, is trust—Chinese clients usually pay upon
        product
        arrival,
        but
        through
        constant
        communication and follow-up, we convinced

          They also left with 200+ workable contacts

          In 2008, it was years of sector specialization
          and research that allowed a local Chinese
          detergent brand called Blue Moon to succeed in
          breaking into a Chinese market dominated by
          Unilever, Proctor & Gamble, and other
          multinational companies. The smaller company
          succeeded because it noticed something about
          the laundry detergent sector that the big
          companies missed.
          <span class="break"></span>
          While the multinationals focused on new
          products for washing machines, Blue Moon
          realized a significant portion of the Chinese
          population was more traditional and still
          hand-washed their clothes. Laundry powder was
          available for hand-washing clothes, but Blue
          Moon introduced a liquid hand-washing
          detergent that provided a better experience (no
          clumping!). Even after the other companies
          caught up, Blue Moon had snagged a steady
          30% of the liquid detergent market.
          <span class="break"></span>
          That’s what happens when you combine cultural
          sensitivity with careful observation of industry
          trends. Of course, it helped that they were
          backed by one of Asia’s top hedge funds,
          Hillhouse Capital, which makes investments and
          gives advice to Chinese start-ups.
          <span class="break"></span>
          But even after their initial success, the company
          didn’t stop their momentum. They continued to
          launch the detergent that worked, focusing on
          their best-selling SKU instead of branching into
          various new detergents.
          <span class="break"></span>
          Instead, they spent money on research and
          marketing. In 2011, a full three years after they
          sucessfully broke into the market, they spent
          USD 500 million alone for advertising. Their
          executives also met with a team from JD.com,
          one of China’s largest on-line marketplaces, to
          find ways to make the delivery process more
          efficient; they redesigned their detergent
          carton to fit with JD’s online delivery boxes.

          In 2012, they cut advertising but then hired
          salespeople to directly interact with customers in
          supermarkets, asking them to sample-smell
          patches of the detergent as if it were a perfume
          in a department store. They were constantly
          trying new strategies to present themselves not
          as the most affordable in their industry but
          instead “different and desirable.”

          Even small brands can beat huge multinationals,

          consumers’ needs more than their competitors.
          Blue Moon proved that with its breakthrough
          liquid laundry detergent for the segment of
          Chinese population that still hand-washed
          clothes. It solved a problem that no other
          company solved for these people, and they won
          loyal customers. Even after initial success
          though, Blue Moon didn’t stop R&D and

        A UK-based bespoke diamond ring brand, Rare
        Pink, wanted to expand to China. 90% of the
        brand’s rings are sold as engagement rings, but
        the whole matter of engagement has different
        cultural
        implications
        here.
        The
        brand
        approached us prior to meeting an important
        potential Chinese partner and investor.
      </p>
      <h5 class="content_title_approach">The LITAO Approach:</h5>
      <p class="content">
        We knew what they really needed was a strong
        pitch to make their case for this investor. And all
        investors are looking for not just good products
        but strong opportunities.
        <span class="break"></span>
        We found that compared to the U.S. market
        which preferred 0.8ct to 1ct diamonds, the
        Chinese market up to now showed preferences
        for smaller 0.3 to 0.7ct diamonds. With China’s
        growing per capita GDP, this demonstrated
        potential for average diamond order values to
        also increase. Desk research yielded many
        interesting insights, and we soon had a
        consumer focus, investment plan, and target
        revenues.
        <span class="break"></span>
        Yet how could the brand itself show off their
        China knowledge without having any experience
        in the Chinese market? LITAO arranged a series
        of mystery shopping visits in Shanghai for the
        company CEO and a selected female
        companion, who pretended to be his fiancee.
        Through our strategically-designed questions,
        they learned from jewelers firsthand what
        designs sold best in their stores (Chinese had
        more desire for colored diamonds(?)); how
        stores were set up (I forget?); and how
        salespeople provided service (with Chinese
        couples being generally more reticent about
        their impending engagement).

        take them seriously. They are still discussing the

        Viciunai Group, the biggest surimi manufacturer
        in Europe and among the top five in the world
        (producing 160,000 tons of food products each
        year), wanted to globalize even further. But how
        could it enter China with its strict food import
        regulations?
      </p>
      <h5 class="content_title_approach">The LITAO Approach:</h5>
      <p class="content">
        China itself is the world’s largest producer of
        surimi and other fish products, and Chinese
        import regulations over the past decades have
        grown ever stricter to protect local interests, to
        the point where quality inspection for products
        coming in have specifications more rigid and
        exacting than those of the EU—this despite
        notoriously low in-country food standards.
        <span class="break"></span>
        Unless a product has been historically imported
        and thus deemed acceptable, it is almost
        impossible to enter China. We informed the
        company of the regulations beforehand. We
        then researched fish from Lithuania that had
        previously been allowed to enter China, limiting
        the company to a stock of six.
        <span class="break"></span>
        This meant changing their surimi formula as they
        were limited to work from a stock of six
        “allowed” fishes.

             This means strategies not only for communicating

             Here is where we apply your brand’s KEY
             MESSAGE from Stage 1. What differentiates
             premium brands from run-of-the-mill ones is how
             well they tell their story. (In China, for example, the
             term “purified water” doesn’t sound good. The
             Chinese simply boil tap water to “purify” it—why
             would they buy it?*)
             <span class="break"></span>
             This stage is about BUILDING the demand with

             with pitch-perfect responses.

             This stage also includes setting up your WeChat

             Import and distribution channels in China are

             must be handled by licensed importers who

             Distribution in China is quite fragmented, being
             generally handled on a store-by-store or
             city-by-city basis, with stores receiving most
             imports through a series of local distributors. This

                    need that you cannot address alone. A

                  A problem or an opportunity. You call us because
                  we have the unique expertise you need. And indeed,
                  what you think is the problem may not be the real
                  problem, and the solution too may not be what you
                  expect.

                  When you have a consultation with us, we leave you
                  with clarity: who you are, why you’re unique, and
                  why others should pay attention to you / work with
                  you / buy from you.

                  For a niche brand to penetrate a new market and
                  succeed in China, it is essential to have a clear brand
                  definition that is in line with the needs of the target
                  audience. Miscommunication of both product and
                  purpose is a huge reason why brands fail.
                  Meanwhile, responsibility for a clear message is up
                  to the communicator, not the listener.

                  accordingly—so that you are not merely competing
                  with other brands, but educating consumers and
                  building a new market segment for your product.
