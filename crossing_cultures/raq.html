                China has been the world’s second largest economy by GDP since 2010, when it surpassed Japan. When GDP is
                adjusted for Purchasing Power Parity, though, China is officially the world’s largest economy, according to the
                International Monetary Fund—meaning the country’s consumers have more individual purchasing power than anywhere
                else in the world. And there are a LOT of consumers: one out of every five people in the world is Chinese.
                <span class="break"></span>
                You may have been hearing that China’s current GDP growth is the lowest it’s been in decades (2016’s was 6.7%). But
                that’s only in comparison to its average growth rate of 10% per year since economic reforms in 1978; it’s still doing
                extremely well in real terms (the U.S. GDP growth for 2016 was less than half of China’s). Slowing down is part of a
                natural process after so much rapid growth.
                <span class="break"></span>
                Much of the slowdown also has to do with China’s shift from being a cheap manufacturer of goods (now that goes to
                countries like Vietnam or Mexico) to more of a major consumer with a huge and rapidly growing middle class. According
                to the 2015 Credit Suisse wealth report, China has a larger middle-class adult population than the
                United States.
                <span class="break"></span>

                <span class="break"></span>
                With such a large sector of new potential consumers, China is really one of the most important countries in the world
                right now in business as well as politics.

              What makes Chinese clients different from others?

              <p>
                Related to the above answer, a huge emergent middle class—the largest in the world now—means also middle class
                values. Western companies used to only target China’s uber-rich (China DOES have a lot of millionaires); but Chinese
                clients are now much more diverse, and no longer only in coastal cities.
                <span class="break"></span>
                So what do Chinese people want? First, there’s no one China or Chinese person: it’s a huge country with distinct
                regions and regional preferences. The differences in consumer appetite between one region of China and another are
                comparable to differences between countries elsewhere, not to mention the differences between Tier-1 cities (Beijing,
                Shanghai) and Tier-3 (Ziyang, Leshan). You really have to know who you’re targeting.
                <span class="break"></span>
                But there are certain trends we can count on.
                <span class="break"></span>
                According to McKinsey’s 2016 China Consumer Report
                <span class="break"></span>
                <a href="" class="color-red">View More</a>
                <span class="break"></span>
                <b> ???????????[see “premium products” image/graph here]????????????</b>
                <span class="break"></span>
                Local brands will always best foreign ones for the mass market share, but Chinese brands aren’t always as trusted for
                premium products, especially for cosmetics and health. 38% of surveyed consumers listed “organic/green food” as
                among their top three criteria—even though China itself doesn’t have a credible organic certification, meaning foreign
                certifications are more important than ever.
                <span class="break"></span>
                China’s consumers are also growing younger, and as such, more Westernized than ever before.
                (<a href="http://www.mckinsey.com/industries/retail/our-insights/mapping-chinas-middle-class" target="blank">http://www.mckinsey.com/industries/retail/our-insights/mapping-chinas-middle-class</a>) They check on-line reviews
                and are more likely to try new things—including specialized items like laundry softeners, unused by their predecessors.
                <span class="break"></span>
                Consumer strategies that used to work—appealing to a wide range of people with a standarized product—don’t
                anymore. Chinese people are becoming much more particular with what they like or not, and strategies need to be
                tailor-made—but the good thing is that compared to previous generations, they spend a higher percentage of their
                earnings—so if they really like something, they won’t necessarily save for later.

                Unlike Europe, where almost everyone with a higher education speaks fluent English, most businesspeople in China

                Not unless your friend also happens to be a part-time diplomat, businessperson, and master negotiator. So much of
                interpretation is beyond language itself but about tone, cultural context, and prior experiential knowledge. If you simply
                allow anyone to translate your company’s documents, be prepared for miscommunication, missing information, or even
                too much(!) information, all at detriment to your cause.

                Unless your product truly has incredible margins (which would be a loss to you), the Chinese really prefer working with
                people who understand China and Chinese. You need someone Chinese-savvy by your side to navigate the market. Even
                simple things like money transfer and payment expectations differ in China. If you can’t establish yourself permanently
                in China, you’ll need someone suppliers and distributors can reach easily. You’ll also need to operate on a whole different
                social media marketing scheme, with China-specific mobile platforms (see What is WeChat? —> <a href="">link to question on
                WeChat</a>); traditional web-sites are not nearly as important in China as mobile.
                <span class="break"></span>

                On the administrative side, with China’s complicated and ever-evolving import/export regulations and labor laws,
                foreign companies are often left out of the loop when the rules change. For employees, the Chinese government
                obligates employers to file staff information with relevant bureaus, maintain files, and pay social benefits and taxes for
                their employees. So even if you decide to sell on your own, if you want any legal Chinese employees, you’ll need a labor
                agency.
                <span class="break"></span>

                Chinese regulations aren’t always by the book, either. Sometimes the official web-site says one thing, but
                word-of-mouth says another. Which one do you think works? If your product is not approved despite thinking you met
                all the requirements, it takes Chinese connections and digging to even understand why. More on legal issues here—> <a href="">link to Chinese legal issues case studies</a>

                As local experts, consultants are your modern-day guides and gurus: part-lawyer, part-interpreter, part-coach. We are
                problem-solvers but also problem-preventers, with culturally-sensitive solutions to market research,
                relationship-building, and strategy. We make things clear for you to take the next step.
                <span class="break"></span>
                Consultants give common sense business advice, backed up by first-hand research, experience, and connections. Here
                at LITAO, though, we do more than give advice: we actually help you implement our suggestions.
                <span class="break"></span>
                A China consultant is a hands-on guide for everything that doesn’t make sense in this country—culturally, linguistically,
                logistically, and legally. We’re different from company agents or representatives because we don’t just follow the status
                quo for business; we help you strategize for long-term growth. And while interpretation is one of our services, helping
                you understand the language and negotiate with business partners is only one small part of the services we provide.

                All cultures have had their advice-givers: from shamans and medicine men to viziers and general counsels.
                <span class="break"></span>
                Shamans take information from other worlds to use in this one. Premiers and viziers counsel their heads of state.
                General counsels give legal advice from decades of litigation experience. All of them act as intermediaries between
                experience and decision. All of them help a tribe, country, or company become better versions of themselves.

                You need to think locally: know which part of the China market you want to expand in and not just China as a whole.
                Once you know that, we can help you develop your key message to consumers.
                <span class="break"></span>
                Other than finding a trusted company to give you advice and consult you locally, we also recommend registering your
                brand and trademark as much beforehand and in as many relevant categories as you can, as China has a first-to-file
                trademark system.
                <span class="break"></span>
                That’s why billionaire Donald Trump registered for ownership of Trump as a trademark in construction services in
                2006—even though as of today, his hotel brand has not entered China.
                <span class="break"></span>
                ( <a href="http://www.economist.com/news/china/21717109-there-was-lot-lose-trump-brand-wins-battle-china" target="blank">http://www.economist.com/news/china/21717109-there-was-lot-lose-trump-brand-wins-battle-china</a>) According
                to the New York Times, Trump owns about 29 of the 46 “TRUMP” trademarks in China. A Chinese court recently
                upheld the trademark, banning the use of the name ownership in the construction sector. Other products, like popular
                brand Trump Toilets, may also be legally questionable—but none of this would have happened if top lawyers for one of
                the wealthiest men in the world hadn’t taken precautions.

              What does due diligence really mean in China, and why is it important
              to do a background-check before buying a load?
            </div>

              <h5 class="color-red"></h5>
              <p>
                Due diligence is really about making sure any company is what it says it is. This ranges from whether or not the company
                actually exists to whether they have positive feedback, regular employees, and good finances; in the course of our work,
                we’ve found fake copy-cat companies before with offshore accounts, or companies with web-sites and no
                manufacturing facilities, or even companies borrowing others’ offices. If you don’t check first, there is no way any court
                can get the money back for you. Assume the worst to guarantee the best. <a href="">[how did Lina save someone 30,000 EUR?]</a>
                <span class="break"></span>
                The above is financial or operational due diligence, and suppliers certified with the ISO (International Orgarganization
                for Standardization) may be qualified on paper, but real-time experience and word-of-mouth reputation is even better.
                You need experienced people to verify if documents, including a business license, are real, as well as to be aware of
                common scams.
                <span class="break"></span>
                The second kind of due diligence actually happens AFTER you’ve found a supplier you want to work with. This is
                factory-level product QC, and again requires regular local visits to ensure quality; even if the first sample batches are
                okay, the factory may cut costs in the future so batches must be checked regularly pre-shipment to ensure product
                quality.

                Owned by Chinese tech giant TenCent, WeChat is China’s answer to Facebook, Skype, WhatsApp, Apple Pay, and
                traditional web-sites—combined. It can do everything from simple and group chats to transferring money, shopping,
                playing games, ordering food, paying bills, hailing cabs, and following your favorite companies. As of 2016, app has
                grown 35% in the last year to 850 million active monthly users and 1.1 billion registered ones, almost all of them in
                China.
                <span class="break"></span>
                The numbers alone don’t show how dedicated users are though: the app has ~750 million DAILY users, half of whom use
                the app at least 90 minutes a day. Also, 85% of users are between the ages of 22 - 55, a core consumer demographic.
                Communicating by WeChat, not e-mail or phone, is the preferred method even for business as well as personal matters.
                <span class="break"></span>
                So much of China, especially the young and new middle-class consumers, do their looking, shopping, and talking on
                mobile, which is becoming increasingly more important than traditional web-sites. East Asia in particular loves mobile
                social network accounts: <a href="http://was-sg.wascdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Slide031.png" target="blank">http://was-sg.wascdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Slide031.png</a>
                <span class="break"></span>
                WeChat also has an enterprise option for companies to open Official Accounts, which people can then follow for news,
                promotions, and group chats. Many companies actually test apps by launching an official WeChat account first to see if
                they’re popular.
